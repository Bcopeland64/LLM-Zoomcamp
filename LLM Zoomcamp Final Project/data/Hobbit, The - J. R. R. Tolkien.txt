["THE HOBBIT\nOR\nTHERE AND BACK AGAIN\nBY\nJ.R.R. TOLKIEN", "The Hobbit is a tale of high adventure, undertaken by a company of\ndwarves, in search of dragon-guarded gold. A reluctant partner in this\nperilous quest is Bilbo Baggins, a comfort-loving, unambitious hobbit, who\nsurprises even himself by his resourcefulness and his skill as a burglar.\nEncounters with trolls, goblins, dwarves, elves and giant spiders,\nconversations with the dragon, Smaug the Magnificent, and a rather\nunwilling presence at the Battle of the Five Armies are some of the\nadventures that befall Bilbo. But there are lighter moments as well: good\nfellowship, welcome meals, laughter and song.\nBilbo Baggins has taken his place among the ranks of the immortals of\nchildren\u2019s fiction. Written for Professor Tolkien\u2019s own children, The Hobbit\nmet with instant acclaim when published. It is a complete and marvellous\ntale in itself, but it also forms a prelude to The Lord of the Rings.\n\u2018One of the most influential books of our generation\u2019\nThe Times", "CONTENTS\nCOVER PAGE\nTITLE PAGE\nLIST OF ILLUSTRATIONS\nNOTE ON THE TEXT\nAUTHOR\u2019S NOTE\nCHAPTER I: AN UNEXPECTED PARTY\nCHAPTER II: ROAST MUTTON\nCHAPTER III: A SHORT REST\nCHAPTER IV: OVER HILL AND UNDER HILL\nCHAPTER V: RIDDLES IN THE DARK\nCHAPTER VI: OUT OF THE FRYING-PAN INTO THE FIRE\nCHAPTER VII: QUEER LODGINGS\nCHAPTER VIII: FLIES AND SPIDERS\nCHAPTER IX: BARRELS OUT OF BOND\nCHAPTER X: A WARM WELCOME\nCHAPTER XI: ON THE DOORSTEP\nCHAPTER XII: INSIDE INFORMATION\nCHAPTER XIII: NOT AT HOME\nCHAPTER XIV: FIRE AND WATER\n\n\fCHAPTER XV: THE GATHERING OF THE CLOUDS\nCHAPTER XVI: A THIEF IN THE NIGHT\nCHAPTER XVII: THE CLOUDS BURST\nCHAPTER XVIII: THE RETURN JOURNEY\nCHAPTER XIX: THE LAST STAGE\nWORKS BY J.R.R.

Its 1951 second edition\n(fifth impression) contains a significantly revised portion of Chapter V,\n\u201cRiddles in the Dark,\u201d which brings the story of The Hobbit more in line\nwith its sequel, The Lord of the Rings, then in progress. Tolkien made some\nfurther revisions to the American edition published by Ballantine Books in\nFebruary 1966, and to the British third edition (sixteenth impression)\npublished by George Allen & Unwin later that same year.\nFor the 1995 British hardcover edition, published by HarperCollins, the\ntext of The Hobbit was entered into word-processing files, and a number of\nfurther corrections of misprints and errors were made. Since then, various\neditions of The Hobbit have been generated from that computerized text\nfile.

At that time the languages and letters were quite\ndifferent from ours of today. English is used to represent the languages. But\ntwo points may be noted. (1) In English the only correct plural of dwarf is\ndwarfs, and the adjective is dwarfish. In this story dwarves and dwarvish\nare used*, but only when speaking of the ancient people to whom Thorin\nOakenshield and his companions belonged. (2) Orc is not an English word.\nIt occurs in one or two places but is usually translated goblin (or hobgoblin\nfor the larger kinds).

Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole,\nfilled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy\nhole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that\nmeans comfort.\nIt had a perfectly round door like a porthole, painted green, with a shiny\nyellow brass knob in the exact middle. The door opened on to a tube-shaped\nhall like a tunnel: a very comfortable tunnel without smoke, with panelled\nwalls, and floors tiled and carpeted, provided with polished chairs, and lots\nand lots of pegs for hats and coats\u2014the hobbit was fond of visitors.

The best rooms were all on the left-hand side (going in), for these\nwere the only ones to have windows, deep-set round windows looking over\nhis garden, and meadows beyond, sloping down to the river.\nThis hobbit was a very well-to-do hobbit, and his name was Baggins.\nThe Bagginses had lived in the neighbourhood of The Hill for time out of\nmind, and people considered them very respectable, not only because most\nof them were rich, but also because they never had any adventures or did\nanything unexpected: you could tell what a Baggins would say on any\nquestion without the bother of asking him.

I suppose\nhobbits need some description nowadays, since they have become rare and", "shy of the Big People, as they call us. They are (or were) a little people,\nabout half our height, and smaller than the bearded Dwarves. Hobbits have\nno beards. There is little or no magic about them, except the ordinary\neveryday sort which helps them to disappear quietly and quickly when large\nstupid folk like you and me come blundering along, making a noise like\nelephants which they can hear a mile off. They are inclined to be fat in the\nstomach; they dress in bright colours (chiefly green and yellow); wear no\nshoes, because their feet grow natural leathery soles and thick warm brown\nhair like the stuff on their heads (which is curly); have long clever brown\nfingers, good-natured faces, and laugh deep fruity laughs (especially after\ndinner, which they have twice a day when they can get it). Now you know\nenough to go on with. As I was saying, the mother of this hobbit\u2014of Bilbo\nBaggins, that is\u2014was the famous Belladonna Took, one of the three", "enough to go on with. As I was saying, the mother of this hobbit\u2014of Bilbo\nBaggins, that is\u2014was the famous Belladonna Took, one of the three\nremarkable daughters of the Old Took, head of the hobbits who lived across\nThe Water, the small river that ran at the foot of The Hill. It was often said\n(in other families) that long ago one of the Took ancestors must have taken\na fairy wife. That was, of course, absurd, but certainly there was still\nsomething not entirely hobbitlike about them, and once in a while members\nof the Took-clan would go and have adventures. They discreetly\ndisappeared, and the family hushed it up; but the fact remained that the\nTooks were not as respectable as the Bagginses, though they were\nundoubtedly richer.\nNot that Belladonna Took ever had any adventures after she became\nMrs. Bungo Baggins.

Still it is probable that Bilbo, her\nonly son, although he looked and behaved exactly like a second edition of\nhis solid and comfortable father, got something a bit queer in his make-up\nfrom the Took side, something that only waited for a chance to come out.\nThe chance never arrived, until Bilbo Baggins was grown up, being about\nfifty years old or so, and living in the beautiful hobbit-hole built by his\nfather, which I have just described for you, until he had in fact apparently\nsettled down immovably.\nBy some curious chance one morning long ago in the quiet of the world,\nwhen there was less noise and more green, and the hobbits were still", "numerous and prosperous, and Bilbo Baggins was standing at his door after\nbreakfast smoking an enormous long wooden pipe that reached nearly down\nto his woolly toes (neatly brushed)\u2014Gandalf came by. Gandalf! If you had\nheard only a quarter of what I have heard about him, and I have only heard\nvery little of all there is to hear, you would be prepared for any sort of\nremarkable tale. Tales and adventures sprouted up all over the place\nwherever he went, in the most extraordinary fashion. He had not been down\nthat way under The Hill for ages and ages, not since his friend the Old Took\ndied, in fact, and the hobbits had almost forgotten what he looked like. He\nhad been away over The Hill and across The Water on businesses of his\nown since they were all small hobbit-boys and hobbit-girls.\nAll that the unsuspecting Bilbo saw that morning was an old man with a\nstaff.

The sun was shining, and\nthe grass was very green. But Gandalf looked at him from under long bushy\neyebrows that stuck out further than the brim of his shady hat.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he said. \u201cDo you wish me a good morning, or\nmean that it is a good morning whether I want it or not; or that you feel\ngood this morning; or that it is a morning to be good on?\u201d\n\u201cAll of them at once,\u201d said Bilbo. \u201cAnd a very fine morning for a pipe of\ntobacco out of doors, into the bargain.

I am looking for someone to share in an adventure that I am\narranging, and it\u2019s very difficult to find anyone.\u201d\n\u201cI should think so\u2014in these parts! We are plain quiet folk and have no\nuse for adventures. Nasty disturbing uncomfortable things! Make you late\nfor dinner! I can\u2019t think what anybody sees in them,\u201d said our Mr. Baggins,\nand stuck one thumb behind his braces, and blew out another even bigger\nsmokering.

But the old man did not\nmove.

He did not\nremember things very well, unless he put them down on his Engagement\nTablet: like this: Gandalf Tea Wednesday. Yesterday he had been too\nflustered to do anything of the kind.\nJust before tea-time there came a tremendous ring on the front-door bell,\nand then he remembered!

At last they pushed their chairs back, and Bilbo\nmade a move to collect the plates and glasses.\n\u201cI suppose you will all stay to supper?\u201d he said in his politest unpressing\ntones.\n\u201cOf course!\u201d said Thorin. \u201cAnd after.

Now to clear up!\u201d\nThereupon the twelve dwarves\u2014not Thorin, he was too important, and\nstayed talking to Gandalf\u2014jumped to their feet, and made tall piles of all\nthe things.

Then they went back, and found Thorin with his feet on the\nfender smoking a pipe. He was blowing the most enormous smoke-rings,\nand wherever he told one to go, it went\u2014up the chimney, or behind the\nclock on the mantelpiece, or under the table, or round and round the ceiling;\nbut wherever it went it was not quick enough to escape Gandalf.

Then Gandalf\u2019s smoke-ring would go green and come back to\nhover over the wizard\u2019s head. He had a cloud of them about him already,\nand in the dim light it made him look strange and sorcerous. Bilbo stood\nstill and watched\u2014he loved smoke-rings\u2014and then he blushed to think\nhow proud he had been yesterday morning of the smoke-rings he had sent\nup the wind over The Hill.\n\u201cNow for some music!\u201d said Thorin. \u201cBring out the instruments!\u201d\nKili and Fili rushed for their bags and brought back little fiddles; Dori,\nNori, and Ori brought out flutes from somewhere inside their coats;\nBombur produced a drum from the hall; Bifur and Bofur went out too, and\ncame back with clarinets that they had left among the walking-sticks.\nDwalin and Balin said: \u201cExcuse me, I left mine in the porch!\u201d \u201cJust bring", "came back with clarinets that they had left among the walking-sticks.\nDwalin and Balin said: \u201cExcuse me, I left mine in the porch!\u201d \u201cJust bring\nmine in with you!\u201d said Thorin.

He looked out of the window. The stars were out\nin a dark sky above the trees. He thought of the jewels of the dwarves\nshining in dark caverns.

So Thorin\nwent on:\n\u201cWe are met to discuss our plans, our ways, means, policy and devices.\nWe shall soon before the break of day start on our long journey, a journey\nfrom which some of us, or perhaps all of us (except our friend and\ncounsellor, the ingenious wizard Gandalf) may never return. It is a solemn", "moment. Our object is, I take it, well known to us all. To the estimable Mr.\nBaggins, and perhaps to one or two of the younger dwarves (I think I should\nbe right in naming Kili and Fili, for instance), the exact situation at the\nmoment may require a little brief explanation\u2014\u201d\nThis was Thorin\u2019s style. He was an important dwarf. If he had been\nallowed, he would probably have gone on like this until he was out of\nbreath, without telling any one there anything that was not known already.\nBut he was rudely interrupted. Poor Bilbo couldn\u2019t bear it any longer. At\nmay never return he began to feel a shriek coming up inside, and very soon\nit burst out like the whistle of an engine coming out of a tunnel. All the\ndwarves sprang up, knocking over the table.

Then he fell flat on the floor, and kept on calling out \u201cstruck by\nlightning, struck by lightning!\u201d over and over again; and that was all they\ncould get out of him for a long time. So they took him and laid him out of\nthe way on the drawing-room sofa with a drink at his elbow, and they went\nback to their dark business.\n\u201cExcitable little fellow,\u201d said Gandalf, as they sat down again. \u201cGets\nfunny queer fits, but he is one of the best, one of the best\u2014as fierce as a\ndragon in a pinch.\u201d\nIf you have ever seen a dragon in a pinch, you will realize that this was\nonly poetical exaggeration applied to any hobbit, even to Old Took\u2019s greatgrand-uncle Bullroarer, who was so huge (for a hobbit) that he could ride a\nhorse. He charged the ranks of the goblins of Mount Gram in the Battle of", "horse.

It sailed a hundred yards through the air and went down a\nrabbit-hole, and in this way the battle was won and the game of Golf\ninvented at the same moment.\nIn the meanwhile, however, Bullroarer\u2019s gentler descendant was\nreviving in the drawing-room. After a while and a drink he crept nervously\nto the door of the parlour. This is what he heard, Gloin speaking: \u201cHumph!\u201d\n(or some snort more or less like that). \u201cWill he do, do you think? It is all\nvery well for Gandalf to talk about this hobbit being fierce, but one shriek\nlike that in a moment of excitement would be enough to wake the dragon\nand all his relatives, and kill the lot of us. I think it sounded more like fright", "than excitement! In fact, if it had not been for the sign on the door, I should\nhave been sure we had come to the wrong house. As soon as I clapped eyes\non the little fellow bobbing and puffing on the mat, I had my doubts. He\nlooks more like a grocer than a burglar!\u201d\nThen Mr. Baggins turned the handle and went in. The Took side had\nwon. He suddenly felt he would go without bed and breakfast to be thought\nfierce. As for little fellow bobbing on the mat it almost made him really\nfierce. Many a time afterwards the Baggins part regretted what he did now,\nand he said to himself: \u201cBilbo, you were a fool; you walked right in and put\nyour foot in it.\u201d\n\u201cPardon me,\u201d he said, \u201cif I have overheard words that you were saying.

For\nvery good reasons. You asked me to find the fourteenth man for your\nexpedition, and I chose Mr. Baggins. Just let any one say I chose the wrong\nman or the wrong house, and you can stop at thirteen and have all the bad\nluck you like, or go back to digging coal.\u201d\nHe scowled so angrily at Gloin that the dwarf huddled back in his chair;\nand when Bilbo tried to open his mouth to ask a question, he turned and\nfrowned at him and stuck out his bushy eyebrows, till Bilbo shut his mouth", "tight with a snap. \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d said Gandalf. \u201cLet\u2019s have no more\nargument.

Now Bilbo, my\nboy, fetch the lamp, and let\u2019s have a little light on this!\u201d\nOn the table in the light of a big lamp with a red shade he spread a piece\nof parchment rather like a map.\n\u201cThis was made by Thror, your grandfather, Thorin,\u201d he said in answer\nto the dwarves\u2019 excited questions. \u201cIt is a plan of the Mountain.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t see that this will help us much,\u201d said Thorin disappointedly\nafter a glance. \u201cI remember the Mountain well enough and the lands about\nit. And I know where Mirkwood is, and the Withered Heath where the great\ndragons bred.\u201d\n\u201cThere is a dragon marked in red on the Mountain,\u201d said Balin, \u201cbut it", "it.

You see that rune on the West side, and the hand\npointing to it from the other runes? That marks a hidden passage to the\nLower Halls.\u201d (Look at the map at the beginning of this book, and you will\nsee there the runes.)\n\u201cIt may have been secret once,\u201d said Thorin, \u201cbut how do we know that\nit is secret any longer? Old Smaug has lived there long enough now to find\nout anything there is to know about those caves.\u201d\n\u201cHe may\u2014but he can\u2019t have used it for years and years.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cBecause it is too small. \u2018Five feet high the door and three may walk\nabreast\u2019 say the runes, but Smaug could not creep into a hole that size, not", "\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cBecause it is too small. \u2018Five feet high the door and three may walk\nabreast\u2019 say the runes, but Smaug could not creep into a hole that size, not\neven when he was a young dragon, certainly not after devouring so many of\nthe dwarves and men of Dale.\u201d\n\u201cIt seems a great big hole to me,\u201d squeaked Bilbo (who had no\nexperience of dragons and only of hobbit-holes). He was getting excited\nand interested again, so that he forgot to keep his mouth shut. He loved\nmaps, and in his hall there hung a large one of the Country Round with all\nhis favourite walks marked on it in red ink. \u201cHow could such a large door", "be kept secret from everybody outside, apart from the dragon?\u201d he asked.\nHe was only a little hobbit you must remember.\n\u201cIn lots of ways,\u201d said Gandalf. \u201cBut in what way this one has been\nhidden we don\u2019t know without going to see. From what it says on the map I\nshould guess there is a closed door which has been made to look exactly\nlike the side of the Mountain. That is the usual dwarves\u2019 method\u2014I think\nthat is right, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cQuite right,\u201d said Thorin.\n\u201cAlso,\u201d went on Gandalf, \u201cI forgot to mention that with the map went a\nkey, a small and curious key.

But we none of us liked the idea\nof the Front Gate. The river runs right out of it through the great cliff at the\nSouth of the Mountain, and out of it comes the dragon too\u2014far too often,\nunless he has changed his habits.\u201d\n\u201cThat would be no good,\u201d said the wizard, \u201cnot without a mighty\nWarrior, even a Hero.

That is why I settled on\nburglary\u2014especially when I remembered the existence of a Side-door. And\nhere is our little Bilbo Baggins, the burglar, the chosen and selected burglar.\nSo now let\u2019s get on and make some plans.\u201d\n\u201cVery well then,\u201d said Thorin, \u201csupposing the burglar-expert gives us\nsome ideas or suggestions.\u201d He turned with mock-politeness to Bilbo.", "\u201cFirst I should like to know a bit more about things,\u201d said he, feeling all\nconfused and a bit shaky inside, but so far still Tookishly determined to go\non with things. \u201cI mean about the gold and the dragon, and all that, and how\nit got there, and who it belongs to, and so on and further.\u201d\n\u201cBless me!\u201d said Thorin, \u201chaven\u2019t you got a map? and didn\u2019t you hear\nour song? and haven\u2019t we been talking about all this for hours?\u201d\n\u201cAll the same, I should like it all plain and clear,\u201d said he obstinately,\nputting on his business manner (usually reserved for people who tried to\nborrow money off him), and doing his best to appear wise and prudent and\nprofessional and live up to Gandalf\u2019s recommendation. \u201cAlso I should like\nto know about risks, out-of-pocket expenses, time required and\nremuneration, and so forth\u201d\u2014by which he meant: \u201cWhat am I going to get\nout of it? and am I going to come back alive?\u201d\n\u201cO very well,\u201d said Thorin. \u201cLong ago in my grandfather Thror\u2019s time", "remuneration, and so forth\u201d\u2014by which he meant: \u201cWhat am I going to get\nout of it? and am I going to come back alive?\u201d\n\u201cO very well,\u201d said Thorin. \u201cLong ago in my grandfather Thror\u2019s time\nour family was driven out of the far North, and came back with all their\nwealth and their tools to this Mountain on the map. It had been discovered\nby my far ancestor, Thrain the Old, but now they mined and they tunnelled\nand they made huger halls and greater workshops\u2014and in addition I believe\nthey found a good deal of gold and a great many jewels too. Anyway they\ngrew immensely rich and famous, and my grandfather was King under the\nMountain again, and treated with great reverence by the mortal men, who\nlived to the South, and were gradually spreading up the Running River as\nfar as the valley overshadowed by the Mountain. They built the merry town\nof Dale there in those days. Kings used to send for our smiths, and reward\neven the least skillful most richly.

Fathers would beg us to take their sons as\napprentices, and pay us handsomely, especially in food-supplies, which we\nnever bothered to grow or find for ourselves. Altogether those were good\ndays for us, and the poorest of us had money to spend and to lend, and\nleisure to make beautiful things just for the fun of it, not to speak of the\nmost marvellous and magical toys, the like of which is not to be found in\nthe world now-a-days. So my grandfather\u2019s halls became full of armour and\njewels and carvings and cups, and the toy market of Dale was the wonder of\nthe North.\n\u201cUndoubtedly that was what brought the dragon. Dragons steal gold and\njewels, you know, from men and elves and dwarves, wherever they can find\nthem; and they guard their plunder as long as they live (which is practically", "for ever, unless they are killed), and never enjoy a brass ring of it.

By that time all the bells were ringing in Dale and the\nwarriors were arming. The dwarves rushed out of their great gate; but there\nwas the dragon waiting for them. None escaped that way. The river rushed\nup in steam and a fog fell on Dale, and in the fog the dragon came on them\nand destroyed most of the warriors\u2014the usual unhappy story, it was only\ntoo common in those days.

Bilbo had just enough wits left, when\nBert dropped him on the ground, to scramble out of the way of their feet,\nbefore they were fighting like dogs, and calling one another all sorts of\nperfectly true and applicable names in very loud voices. Soon they were\nlocked in one another\u2019s arms, and rolling nearly into the fire kicking and", "thumping, while Tom whacked at them both with a branch to bring them to\ntheir senses\u2014and that of course only made them madder than ever.\nThat would have been the time for Bilbo to have left. But his poor little\nfeet had been very squashed in Bert\u2019s big paw, and he had no breath in his\nbody, and his head was going round; so there he lay for a while panting, just\noutside the circle of firelight.\nRight in the middle of the fight up came Balin. The dwarves had heard\nnoises from a distance, and after waiting for some time for Bilbo to come\nback, or to hoot like an owl, they started off one by one to creep towards the\nlight as quietly as they could. No sooner did Tom see Balin come into the\nlight than he gave an awful howl. Trolls simply detest the very sight of\ndwarves (uncooked). Bert and Bill stopped fighting immediately, and \u201ca\nsack, Tom, quick!\u201d they said. Before Balin, who was wondering where in\nall this commotion Bilbo was, knew what was happening, a sack was over", "sack, Tom, quick!\u201d they said. Before Balin, who was wondering where in\nall this commotion Bilbo was, knew what was happening, a sack was over\nhis head, and he was down.\n\u201cThere\u2019s more to come yet,\u201d said Tom, \u201cor I\u2019m mighty mistook. Lots\nand none at all, it is,\u201d said he. \u201cNo burrahobbits, but lots of these here\ndwarves. That\u2019s about the shape of it!\u201d\n\u201cI reckon you\u2019re right,\u201d said Bert, \u201cand we\u2019d best get out of the light.\u201d\nAnd so they did. With sacks in their hands, that they used for carrying\noff mutton and other plunder, they waited in the shadows. As each dwarf\ncame up and looked at the fire, and the spilled jugs, and the gnawed mutton,\nin surprise, pop! went a nasty smelly sack over his head, and he was down.\nSoon Dwalin lay by Balin, and Fili and Kili together, and Dori and Nori and\nOri all in a heap, and Oin and Gloin and Bifur and Bofur and Bombur piled\nuncomfortably near the fire.\n\u201cThat\u2019ll teach \u2019em,\u201d said Tom; for Bifur and Bombur had given a lot of", "Ori all in a heap, and Oin and Gloin and Bifur and Bofur and Bombur piled\nuncomfortably near the fire.\n\u201cThat\u2019ll teach \u2019em,\u201d said Tom; for Bifur and Bombur had given a lot of\ntrouble, and fought like mad, as dwarves will when cornered.\nThorin came last\u2014and he was not caught unawares. He came expecting\nmischief, and didn\u2019t need to see his friends\u2019 legs sticking out of sacks to tell\nhim that things were not all well. He stood outside in the shadows some\nway off, and said: \u201cWhat\u2019s all this trouble? Who has been knocking my\npeople about?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s trolls!\u201d said Bilbo from behind a tree. They had forgotten all about\nhim. \u201cThey\u2019re hiding in the bushes with sacks,\u201d said he.", "\u201cO! are they?\u201d said Thorin, and he jumped forward to the fire, before\nthey could leap on him. He caught up a big branch all on fire at one end;\nand Bert got that end in his eye before he could step aside. That put him out\nof the battle for a bit. Bilbo did his best. He caught hold of Tom\u2019s leg\u2014as\nwell as he could, it was thick as a young tree-trunk\u2014but he was sent\nspinning up into the top of some bushes, when Tom kicked the sparks up in\nThorin\u2019s face.\n\nThe Trolls", "The Trolls\n\n\fTom got the branch in his teeth for that, and lost one of the front ones. It\nmade him howl, I can tell you. But just at that moment William came up\nbehind and popped a sack right over Thorin\u2019s head and down to his toes.\nAnd so the fight ended. A nice pickle they were all in now: all neatly tied up\nin sacks, with three angry trolls (and two with burns and bashes to\nremember) sitting by them, arguing whether they should roast them slowly,\nor mince them fine and boil them, or just sit on them one by one and squash\nthem into jelly; and Bilbo up in a bush, with his clothes and his skin torn,\nnot daring to move for fear they should hear him.", "It was just then that Gandalf came back. But no one saw him. The trolls had\njust decided to roast the dwarves now and eat them later\u2014that was Bert\u2019s\nidea, and after a lot of argument they had all agreed to it.\n\u201cNo good roasting \u2019em now, it\u2019d take all night,\u201d said a voice. Bert\nthought it was William\u2019s.\n\u201cDon\u2019t start the argument all over again, Bill,\u201d he said, \u201cor it will take all\nnight.\u201d\n\u201cWho\u2019s a-arguing?\u201d said William, who thought it was Bert that had\nspoken.\n\u201cYou are,\u201d said Bert.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a liar,\u201d said William; and so the argument began all over again.\nIn the end they decided to mince them fine and boil them. So they got a\ngreat black pot, and they took out their knives.\n\u201cNo good boiling \u2019em! We ain\u2019t got no water, and it\u2019s a long way to the\nwell and all,\u201d said a voice.

They had to hear Bilbo\u2019s account of what had happened\nto him twice over, before they were satisfied.\n\u201cSilly time to go practising pinching and pocket-picking,\u201d said Bombur,\n\u201cwhen what we wanted was fire and food!\u201d", "\u201cAnd that\u2019s just what you wouldn\u2019t have got of those fellows without a\nstruggle, in any case,\u201d said Gandalf. \u201cAnyhow you are wasting time now.\nDon\u2019t you realize that the trolls must have a cave or a hole dug somewhere\nnear to hide from the sun in? We must look into it!\u201d\nThey searched about, and soon found the marks of trolls\u2019 stony boots\ngoing away through the trees. They followed the tracks up the hill, until\nhidden by bushes they came on a big door of stone leading to a cave. But\nthey could not open it, not though they all pushed while Gandalf tried\nvarious incantations.\n\u201cWould this be any good?\u201d asked Bilbo, when they were getting tired\nand angry. \u201cI found it on the ground where the trolls had their fight.\u201d He\nheld out a largish key, though no doubt William had thought it very small\nand secret.

Gandalf\ngrabbed it and fitted it into the keyhole. Then the stone door swung back\nwith one big push, and they all went inside. There were bones on the floor\nand a nasty smell was in the air; but there was a good deal of food jumbled\ncarelessly on shelves and on the ground, among an untidy litter of plunder,\nof all sorts from brass buttons to pots full of gold coins standing in a corner.\nThere were lots of clothes, too, hanging on the walls\u2014too small for trolls, I\nam afraid they belonged to victims\u2014and among them were several swords\nof various makes, shapes, and sizes. Two caught their eyes particularly,\nbecause of their beautiful scabbards and jewelled hilts.\nGandalf and Thorin each took one of these; and Bilbo took a knife in a\nleather sheath.

It would have made only a tiny pocket-knife for a troll, but it\nwas as good as a short sword for the hobbit.\n\u201cThese look like good blades,\u201d said the wizard, half drawing them and\nlooking at them curiously. \u201cThey were not made by any troll, nor by any\nsmith among men in these parts and days; but when we can read the runes\non them, we shall know more about them.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s get out of this horrible smell!\u201d said Fili. So they carried out the\npots of coins, and such food as was untouched and looked fit to eat, also\none barrel of ale which was still full. By that time they felt like breakfast,\nand being very hungry they did not turn their noses up at what they had got\nfrom the trolls\u2019 larder. Their own provisions were very scanty. Now they", "had bread and cheese, and plenty of ale, and bacon to toast in the embers of\nthe fire.\nAfter that they slept, for their night had been disturbed; and they did\nnothing more till the afternoon. Then they brought up their ponies, and\ncarried away the pots of gold, and buried them very secretly not far from\nthe track by the river, putting a great many spells over them, just in case\nthey ever had the chance to come back and recover them. When that was\ndone, they all mounted once more, and jogged along again on the path\ntowards the East.\n\u201cWhere did you go to, if I may ask?\u201d said Thorin to Gandalf as they rode\nalong.\n\u201cTo look ahead,\u201d said he.\n\u201cAnd what brought you back in the nick of time?\u201d \u201cLooking behind,\u201d\nsaid he.\n\u201cExactly!\u201d said Thorin; \u201cbut could you be more plain?\u201d\n\u201cI went on to spy out our road.

They had begun to feel that\ndanger was not far away on either side. They camped under the stars, and\ntheir horses had more to eat than they had; for there was plenty of grass, but\nthere was not much in their bags, even with what they had got from the\ntrolls. One morning they forded a river at a wide shallow place full of the\nnoise of stones and foam. The far bank was steep and slippery. When they\ngot to the top of it, leading their ponies, they saw that the great mountains\nhad marched down very near to them.

Then came a wind", "and a rain, and the wind whipped the rain and the hail about in every\ndirection, so that an overhanging rock was no protection at all. Soon they\nwere getting drenched and their ponies were standing with their heads down\nand their tails between their legs, and some of them were whinnying with\nfright.

There is\nnothing like looking, if you want to find something (or so Thorin said to the\nyoung dwarves).

So it proved on this\noccasion.\nSoon Fili and Kili came crawling back, holding on to the rocks in the\nwind. \u201cWe have found a dry cave,\u201d they said, \u201cnot far round the next\ncorner; and ponies and all could get inside.\u201d\n\u201cHave you thoroughly explored it?\u201d said the wizard, who knew that\ncaves up in the mountains were seldom unoccupied.", "corner; and ponies and all could get inside.\u201d\n\u201cHave you thoroughly explored it?\u201d said the wizard, who knew that\ncaves up in the mountains were seldom unoccupied.\n\u201cYes, yes!\u201d they said, though everybody knew they could not have been\nlong about it; they had come back too quick. \u201cIt isn\u2019t all that big, and it does\nnot go far back.\u201d\nThat, of course, is the dangerous part about caves: you don\u2019t know how\nfar they go back, sometimes, or where a passage behind may lead to, or\nwhat is waiting for you inside.

He lit up his wand\u2014as\nhe did that day in Bilbo\u2019s dining-room that seemed so long ago, if you\nremember\u2014, and by its light they explored the cave from end to end.\nIt seemed quite a fair size, but not too large and mysterious.

They talked and talked, and forgot about the storm, and\ndiscussed what each would do with his share of the treasure (when they got\nit, which at the moment did not seem so impossible); and so they dropped\noff to sleep one by one. And that was the last time that they used the ponies,\npackages, baggages, tools and paraphernalia that they had brought with\nthem.\nIt turned out a good thing that night that they had brought little Bilbo\nwith them, after all.

Not for a long while did they stop, and by that time they\nmust have been right down in the very mountain\u2019s heart.\nThen Gandalf lit up his wand. Of course it was Gandalf; but just then\nthey were too busy to ask how he got there. He took out his sword again,\nand again it flashed in the dark by itself.

His head was\nswimming, and he was far from certain even of the direction they had been\ngoing in when he had his fall. He guessed as well as he could, and crawled\nalong for a good way, till suddenly his hand met what felt like a tiny ring of\ncold metal lying on the floor of the tunnel.

Goodness knows what the striking of\nmatches and the smell of tobacco would have brought on him out of dark\nholes in that horrible place. Still at the moment he felt very crushed. But in\nslapping all his pockets and feeling all round himself for matches his hand\ncame on the hilt of his little sword\u2014the little dagger that he got from the\ntrolls, and that he had quite forgotten; nor fortunately had the goblins\nnoticed it, as he wore it inside his breeches.\nNow he drew it out.

He had heard of such things, of course, in old old tales; but it\nwas hard to believe that he really had found one, by accident.

Goblins might be about, and he had lost his ring. At last he\nstopped by a low opening, on their left as they went up.\n\u201cSeven right, yes. Six left, yes!\u201d he whispered. \u201cThis is it.

Gollum had brought Bilbo to the way out\nafter all, but Bilbo could not get in! There was Gollum sitting humped up\nright in the opening, and his eyes gleamed cold in his head, as he swayed it\nfrom side to side between his knees.\nBilbo crept away from the wall more quietly than a mouse; but Gollum\nstiffened at once, and sniffed, and his eyes went green. He hissed softly but\nmenacingly. He could not see the hobbit, but now he was on the alert, and\nhe had other senses that the darkness had sharpened: hearing and smell. He\nseemed to be crouched right down with his flat hands splayed on the floor,\nand his head thrust out, nose almost to the stone. Though he was only a", "black shadow in the gleam of his own eyes, Bilbo could see or feel that he\nwas tense as a bowstring, gathered for a spring.\nBilbo almost stopped breathing, and went stiff himself.

No, not a fair fight. He was invisible now. Gollum\nhad no sword. Gollum had not actually threatened to kill him, or tried to\nyet. And he was miserable, alone, lost. A sudden understanding, a pity\nmixed with horror, welled up in Bilbo\u2019s heart: a glimpse of endless\nunmarked days without light or hope of betterment, hard stone, cold fish,\nsneaking and whispering. All these thoughts passed in a flash of a second.\nHe trembled.

He did not turn to see what\nGollum was doing. There was a hissing and cursing almost at his heels at\nfirst, then it stopped. All at once there came a blood-curdling shriek, filled\nwith hatred and despair. Gollum was defeated. He dared go no further. He\nhad lost: lost his prey, and lost, too, the only thing he had ever cared for, his\nprecious.

Careful now, or this way will lead you to worse\nthings.\u201d\nThe passage was low and roughly made. It was not too difficult for the\nhobbit, except when, in spite of all care, he stubbed his poor toes again,\nseveral times, on nasty jagged stones in the floor. \u201cA bit low for goblins, at\nleast for the big ones,\u201d thought Bilbo, not knowing that even the big ones,", "the orcs of the mountains, go along at a great speed stooping low with their\nhands almost on the ground.\nSoon the passage that had been sloping down began to go up again, and\nafter a while it climbed steeply.

Not red light, as of fire or lantern, but a pale out-ofdoors sort of light. Then Bilbo began to run.\nScuttling as fast as his legs would carry him he turned the last corner\nand came suddenly right into an open space, where the light, after all that\ntime in the dark, seemed dazzlingly bright. Really it was only a leak of\nsunshine in through a doorway, where a great door, a stone door, was left\nstanding open.\nBilbo blinked, and then suddenly he saw the goblins: goblins in full\narmour with drawn swords sitting just inside the door, and watching it with", "standing open.\nBilbo blinked, and then suddenly he saw the goblins: goblins in full\narmour with drawn swords sitting just inside the door, and watching it with\nwide eyes, and watching the passage that led to it.

Whether it\nwas an accident, or a last trick of the ring before it took a new master, it was\nnot on his finger. With yells of delight the goblins rushed upon him.\nA pang of fear and loss, like an echo of Gollum\u2019s misery, smote Bilbo,\nand forgetting even to draw his sword he struck his hands into his pockets.\nAnd there was the ring still, in his left pocket, and it slipped on his finger.\nThe goblins stopped short. They could not see a sign of him. He had\nvanished.

He had just made up his mind that it was his duty, that he must\nturn back\u2014and very miserable he felt about it\u2014when he heard voices.\nHe stopped and listened. It did not sound like goblins; so he crept\nforward carefully. He was on a stony path winding downwards with a rocky\nwall on the left hand; on the other side the ground sloped away and there\nwere dells below the level of the path overhung with bushes and low trees.\nIn one of these dells under the bushes people were talking.\nHe crept still nearer, and suddenly he saw peering between two big\nboulders a head with a red hood on: it was Balin doing look-out. He could", "have clapped and shouted for joy, but he did not. He had still got the ring\non, for fear of meeting something unexpected and unpleasant, and he saw\nthat Balin was looking straight at him without noticing him.\n\u201cI will give them all a surprise,\u201d he thought, as he crawled into the\nbushes at the edge of the dell. Gandalf was arguing with the dwarves. They\nwere discussing all that had happened to them in the tunnels, and wondering\nand debating what they were to do now. The dwarves were grumbling, and\nGandalf was saying that they could not possibly go on with their journey\nleaving Mr. Baggins in the hands of the goblins, without trying to find out if\nhe was alive or dead, and without trying to rescue him.\n\u201cAfter all he is my friend,\u201d said the wizard, \u201cand not a bad little chap.

Either you help me to look for him, or I go and leave you here\nto get out of the mess as best you can yourselves. If we can only find him\nagain, you will thank me before all is over. Whatever did you want to go\nand drop him for, Dori?\u201d\n\u201cYou would have dropped him,\u201d said Dori, \u201cif a goblin had suddenly\ngrabbed your legs from behind in the dark, tripped up your feet, and kicked\nyou in the back!\u201d\n\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you pick him up again?\u201d\n\u201cGood heavens!

You nearly chopped\noff my head with Glamdring, and Thorin was stabbing here there and\neverywhere with Orcrist. All of a sudden you gave one of your blinding\nflashes, and we saw the goblins running back yelping. You shouted \u2018follow\nme everybody!\u2019 and everybody ought to have followed. We thought\neverybody had. There was no time to count, as you know quite well, till we\nhad dashed through the gate-guards, out of the lower door, and helterskelter down here.

Then they shouted with surprise and\ndelight. Gandalf was as astonished as any of them, but probably more\npleased than all the others. He called to Balin and told him what he thought\nof a look-out man who let people walk right into them like that without\nwarning. It is a fact that Bilbo\u2019s reputation went up a very great deal with\nthe dwarves after this. If they had still doubted that he was really a firstclass burglar, in spite of Gandalf\u2019s words, they doubted no longer. Balin\nwas the most puzzled of all; but everyone said it was a very clever bit of\nwork.\nIndeed Bilbo was so pleased with their praise that he just chuckled\ninside and said nothing whatever about the ring; and when they asked him\nhow he did it, he said: \u201cOh, just crept along, you know\u2014very carefully and\nquietly.\u201d\n\u201cWell, it is the first time that even a mouse has crept along carefully and", "how he did it, he said: \u201cOh, just crept along, you know\u2014very carefully and\nquietly.\u201d\n\u201cWell, it is the first time that even a mouse has crept along carefully and\nquietly under my very nose and not been spotted,\u201d said Balin, \u201cand I take\noff my hood to you.\u201d Which he did.\n\u201cBalin at your service,\u201d said he.\n\u201cYour servant, Mr. Baggins,\u201d said Bilbo.\nThen they wanted to know all about his adventures after they had lost\nhim, and he sat down and told them everything\u2014except about the finding\nof the ring (\u201cnot just now\u201d he thought). They were particularly interested in\nthe riddle-competition, and shuddered most appreciatively at his description\nof Gollum.\n\u201cAnd then I couldn\u2019t think of any other question with him sitting beside\nme,\u201d ended Bilbo; \u201cso I said \u2018what\u2019s in my pocket?\u2019 And he couldn\u2019t guess\nin three goes.

So I jumped over him and\nescaped, and ran down to the gate.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about the guards?\u201d they asked. \u201cWeren\u2019t there any?\u201d\n\u201cO yes! lots of them; but I dodged \u2019em.

He wanted to know how\nthe wizard had turned up again, and where they had all got to now.\nThe wizard, to tell the truth, never minded explaining his cleverness\nmore than once, so now he told Bilbo that both he and Elrond had been well\naware of the presence of evil goblins in that part of the mountains. But their", "more than once, so now he told Bilbo that both he and Elrond had been well\naware of the presence of evil goblins in that part of the mountains. But their\nmain gate used to come out on a different pass, one more easy to travel by,\nso that they often caught people benighted near their gates. Evidently\npeople had given up going that way, and the goblins must have opened their\nnew entrance at the top of the pass the dwarves had taken, quite recently,\nbecause it had been found quite safe up to now.\n\u201cI must see if I can\u2019t find a more or less decent giant to block it up\nagain,\u201d said Gandalf, \u201cor soon there will be no getting over the mountains at\nall.\u201d\nAs soon as Gandalf had heard Bilbo\u2019s yell he realized what had\nhappened. In the flash which killed the goblins that were grabbing him he\nhad nipped inside the crack, just as it snapped to.

The rest we all\nknow\u2014except that Gandalf knew all about the back-door, as the goblins\ncalled the lower gate, where Bilbo lost his buttons.

They guard it always and no one has\never managed to block it up. They will guard it doubly after this,\u201d he\nlaughed.\nAll the others laughed too. After all they had lost a good deal, but they\nhad killed the Great Goblin and a great many others besides, and they had\nall escaped, so they might be said to have had the best of it so far.\nBut the wizard called them to their senses. \u201cWe must be getting on at\nonce, now we are a little rested,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will be out after us in\nhundreds when night comes on; and already shadows are lengthening.

When they began to go down this,\nrubbish and small pebbles rolled away from their feet; soon larger bits of\nsplit stone went clattering down and started other pieces below them\nslithering and rolling; then lumps of rock were disturbed and bounded off,\ncrashing down with a dust and a noise.

They slid into the edge of\na climbing wood of pines that here stood right up the mountain slope from\nthe deeper darker forests of the valleys below. Some caught hold of the\ntrunks and swung themselves into lower branches, some (like the little\nhobbit) got behind a tree to shelter from the onslaught of the rocks. Soon\nthe danger was over, the slide had stopped, and the last faint crashes could\nbe heard as the largest of the disturbed stones went bounding and spinning\namong the bracken and the pine-roots far below.\n\u201cWell! that has got us on a bit,\u201d said Gandalf; \u201cand even goblins tracking\nus will have a job to come down here quietly.\u201d\n\u201cI daresay,\u201d grumbled Bombur; \u201cbut they won\u2019t find it difficult to send\nstones bouncing down on our heads.\u201d The dwarves (and Bilbo) were feeling", "us will have a job to come down here quietly.\u201d\n\u201cI daresay,\u201d grumbled Bombur; \u201cbut they won\u2019t find it difficult to send\nstones bouncing down on our heads.\u201d The dwarves (and Bilbo) were feeling\nfar from happy, and were rubbing their bruised and damaged legs and feet.\n\u201cNonsense!

Others waved their\nspears and clashed the shafts against their shields. Goblins are not afraid of\nfire, and they soon had a plan which seemed to them most amusing.\nSome got all the wolves together in a pack. Some stacked fern and\nbrushwood round the tree-trunks.

They did this for a long while, and at last the hobbit\nopened his eyes again.

These\nwere all the chairs he had in his hall, and he probably had them low like the\ntables for the convenience of the wonderful animals that waited on him.\nWhat did the rest sit on?

I had to\nwalk miles before I found a place where the river was wide and shallow\nenough for me to wade and swim, and then miles back again to pick up the\ntracks again. By that time it was too late for me to follow them far. They\nwent straight off in the direction of the pine-woods on the east side of the\nMisty Mountains, where we had our pleasant little party with the Wargs the\nnight before last.

A\ngoblin\u2019s head was stuck outside the gate and a warg-skin was nailed to a\ntree just beyond. Beorn was a fierce enemy.

Before Thorin could cry out three of the\ndwarves had leaped to their feet and loosed off arrows from their bows.\nNone seemed to find their mark. The deer turned and vanished in the trees\nas silently as they had come, and in vain the dwarves shot their arrows after\nthem.\n\u201cStop! stop!\u201d shouted Thorin; but it was too late, the excited dwarves\nhad wasted their last arrows, and now the bows that Beorn had given them\nwere useless.\nThey were a gloomy party that night, and the gloom gathered still deeper\non them in the following days. They had crossed the enchanted stream; but\nbeyond it the path seemed to straggle on just as before, and in the forest\nthey could see no change. Yet if they had known more about it and\nconsidered the meaning of the hunt and the white deer that had appeared", "they could see no change. Yet if they had known more about it and\nconsidered the meaning of the hunt and the white deer that had appeared\nupon their path, they would have known that they were at last drawing\ntowards the eastern edge, and would soon have come, if they could have\nkept up their courage and their hope, to thinner trees and places where the\nsunlight came again.\nBut they did not know this, and they were burdened with the heavy body\nof Bombur, which they had to carry along with them as best they could,\ntaking the wearisome task in turns of four each while the others shared their\npacks. If these had not become all too light in the last few days, they would\nnever have managed it; but a slumbering and smiling Bombur was a poor\nexchange for packs filled with food however heavy. In a few days a time\ncame when there was practically nothing left to eat or to drink.

Nothing\nwholesome could they see growing in the wood, only funguses and herbs\nwith pale leaves and unpleasant smell.\nAbout four days from the enchanted stream they came to a part where\nmost of the trees were beeches. They were at first inclined to be cheered by\nthe change, for here there was no undergrowth and the shadow was not so\ndeep. There was a greenish light about them, and in places they could see\nsome distance to either side of the path. Yet the light only showed them\nendless lines of straight grey trunks like the pillars of some huge twilight\nhall. There was a breath of air and a noise of wind, but it had a sad sound. A\nfew leaves came rustling down to remind them that outside autumn was", "coming on. Their feet ruffled among the dead leaves of countless other\nautumns that drifted over the banks of the path from the deep red carpets of\nthe forest.\nStill Bombur slept and they grew very weary. At times they heard\ndisquieting laughter. Sometimes there was singing in the distance too. The\nlaughter was the laughter of fair voices not of goblins, and the singing was\nbeautiful, but it sounded eerie and strange, and they were not comforted,\nrather they hurried on from those parts with what strength they had left.\nTwo days later they found their path going downwards, and before long\nthey were in a valley filled almost entirely with a mighty growth of oaks.\n\u201cIs there no end to this accursed forest?\u201d said Thorin. \u201cSomebody must\nclimb a tree and see if he can get his head above the roof and have a look\nround.

He pushed his way\nthrough the tangled twigs with many a slap in the eye; he was greened and\ngrimed from the old bark of the greater boughs; more than once he slipped\nand caught himself just in time; and at last, after a dreadful struggle in a\ndifficult place where there seemed to be no convenient branches at all, he\ngot near the top.

But they were only small ones of ordinary size, and they\nwere after the butterflies. Bilbo\u2019s eyes were nearly blinded by the light. He\ncould hear the dwarves shouting up at him from far below, but he could not\nanswer, only hold on and blink. The sun was shining brilliantly, and it was a\nlong while before he could bear it. When he could, he saw all round him a\nsea of dark green, ruffled here and there by the breeze; and there were\neverywhere hundreds of butterflies. I expect they were a kind of \u201cpurple\nemperor\u201d, a butterfly that loves the tops of oak-woods, but these were not\npurple at all, they were a dark dark velvety black without any markings to\nbe seen.", "He looked at the \u201cblack emperors\u201d for a long time, and enjoyed the feel\nof the breeze in his hair and on his face; but at length the cries of the\ndwarves, who were now simply stamping with impatience down below,\nreminded him of his real business. It was no good. Gaze as much as he\nmight, he could see no end to the trees and the leaves in any direction. His\nheart, that had been lightened by the sight of the sun and the feel of the\nwind, sank back into his toes: there was no food to go back to down below.\nActually, as I have told you, they were not far off the edge of the forest;\nand if Bilbo had had the sense to see it, the tree that he had climbed, though\nit was tall in itself, was standing near the bottom of a wide valley, so that\nfrom its top the trees seemed to swell up all round like the edges of a great\nbowl, and he could not expect to see how far the forest lasted.

And what is the use of sending a hobbit!\u201d they cried,\nas if it was his fault.

That only\nreminded them that they were also parchingly thirsty, without doing\nanything to relieve them: you cannot quench a terrible thirst by standing\nunder giant oaks and waiting for a chance drip to fall on your tongue. The\nonly scrap of comfort there was came unexpectedly from Bombur.\nHe woke up suddenly and sat up scratching his head. He could not make\nout where he was at all, nor why he felt so hungry; for he had forgotten\neverything that had happened since they started their journey that May\nmorning long ago. The last thing that he remembered was the party at the", "hobbit\u2019s house, and they had great difficulty in making him believe their\ntale of all the many adventures they had had since.\nWhen he heard that there was nothing to eat, he sat down and wept, for\nhe felt very weak and wobbly in the legs. \u201cWhy ever did I wake up!\u201d he\ncried. \u201cI was having such beautiful dreams. I dreamed I was walking in a\nforest rather like this one, only lit with torches on the trees and lamps\nswinging from the branches and fires burning on the ground; and there was\na great feast going on, going on for ever. A woodland king was there with a\ncrown of leaves, and there was a merry singing, and I could not count or\ndescribe the things there were to eat and drink.\u201d\n\u201cYou need not try,\u201d said Thorin. \u201cIn fact if you can\u2019t talk about\nsomething else, you had better be silent.

This they did all that day, going very slowly\nand wearily; while Bombur kept on wailing that his legs would not carry\nhim and that he wanted to lie down and sleep.\n\u201cNo you don\u2019t!\u201d they said. \u201cLet your legs take their share, we have\ncarried you far enough.\u201d\nAll the same he suddenly refused to go a step further and flung himself\non the ground. \u201cGo on, if you must,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just going to lie here and\nsleep and dream of food, if I can\u2019t get it any other way.

Even\nBombur got up, and they hurried along then, not caring if it was trolls or\ngoblins.

They argued about it\nbackwards and forwards for a long while, until they agreed at length to send\nout a couple of spies, to creep near the lights and find out more about them.\nBut then they could not agree on who was to be sent: no one seemed\nanxious to run the chance of being lost and never finding his friends again.\nIn the end, in spite of warnings, hunger decided them, because Bombur kept\non describing all the good things that were being eaten, according to his\ndream, in the woodland feast; so they all left the path and plunged into the\nforest together.", "on describing all the good things that were being eaten, according to his\ndream, in the woodland feast; so they all left the path and plunged into the\nforest together.\nAfter a good deal of creeping and crawling they peered round the trunks\nand looked into a clearing where some trees had been felled and the ground\nlevelled. There were many people there, elvish-looking folk, all dressed in\ngreen and brown and sitting on sawn rings of the felled trees in a great\ncircle. There was a fire in their midst and there were torches fastened to\nsome of the trees round about; but most splendid sight of all: they were\neating and drinking and laughing merrily.\nThe smell of the roast meats was so enchanting that, without waiting to\nconsult one another, every one of them got up and scrambled forwards into\nthe ring with the one idea of begging for some food.

After blundering\nfrantically in the gloom, falling over logs, bumping crash into trees, and\nshouting and calling till they must have waked everything in the forest for\nmiles, at last they managed to gather themselves in a bundle and count\nthemselves by touch. By that time they had, of course, quite forgotten in\nwhat direction the path lay, and they were all hopelessly lost, at least till\nmorning.", "There was nothing for it but to settle down for the night where they\nwere; they did not even dare to search on the ground for scraps of food for\nfear of becoming separated again. But they had not been lying long, and\nBilbo was only just getting drowsy, when Dori, whose turn it was to watch\nfirst, said in a loud whisper:\n\u201cThe lights are coming out again over there, and there are more than\never of them.\u201d\nUp they all jumped. There, sure enough, not far away were scores of\ntwinkling lights, and they heard the voices and the laughter quite plainly.\nThey crept slowly towards them, in a single line, each touching the back of\nthe one in front. When they got near Thorin said: \u201cNo rushing forward this\ntime! No one is to stir from hiding till I say. I shall send Mr. Baggins alone\nfirst to talk to them.

The forest was grim and silent, but\nobviously he had first of all to look for his friends, who were not likely to\nbe very far off, unless they had been made prisoners by the elves (or worse\nthings).

Bilbo was a pretty fair shot with a stone,\nand it did not take him long to find a nice smooth egg-shaped one that fitted\nhis hand cosily. As a boy he used to practise throwing stones at things, until\nrabbits and squirrels, and even birds, got out of his way as quick as\nlightning if they saw him stoop; and even grownup he had still spent a deal\nof his time at quoits, dart-throwing, shooting at the wand, bowls, ninepins\nand other quiet games of the aiming and throwing sort\u2014indeed he could do\nlots of things, besides blowing smoke-rings, asking riddles and cooking,\nthat I haven\u2019t had time to tell you about.

After that there\nwas a deal of commotion in the spider-colony, and they forgot the dwarves\nfor a bit, I can tell you. They could not see Bilbo, but they could make a\ngood guess at the direction from which the stones were coming.

When about", "fifty had gone off to the place where he had stood before, he threw some\nmore stones at these, and at others that had stopped behind; then dancing\namong the trees he began to sing a song to infuriate them and bring them all\nafter him, and also to let the dwarves hear his voice.\nThis is what he sang:\nOld fat spider spinning in a tree!\nOld fat spider can\u2019t see me!\nAttercop!

Very soon the\nhobbit would be caught in a thick fence of them all round him\u2014that at least\nwas the spiders\u2019 idea.

Out came his little sword. He slashed the threads to\npieces and went off singing.\nThe spiders saw the sword, though I don\u2019t suppose they knew what it\nwas, and at once the whole lot of them came hurrying after the hobbit along\nthe ground and the branches, hairy legs waving, nippers and spinners\nsnapping, eyes popping, full of froth and rage.

I am afraid Bilbo actually laughed at the\nsight of him jerking his stiff arms and legs as he danced on the spider-string\nunder his armpits, just like one of those funny toys bobbing on a wire.\nSomehow or other Fili was got on to the branch, and then he did his best\nto help the hobbit, although he was feeling very sick and ill from spiderpoison, and from hanging most of the night and the next day wound round\nand round with only his nose to breathe through.

He darted backwards and forwards, slashing at spiderthreads, hacking at their legs, and stabbing at their fat bodies if they came\ntoo near.

Whether it was one of those they had seen the night\nbefore, they could not tell. But it seemed that some good magic lingered in\nsuch spots, which the spiders did not like.

Balin in particular insisted on\nhaving the Gollum story, riddles and all, told all over again, with the ring in\nits proper place. But after a time the light began to fail, and then other\nquestions were asked. Where were they, and where was their path, and\nwhere was there any food, and what were they going to do next? These\nquestions they asked over and over again, and it was from little Bilbo that\nthey seemed to expect to get the answers.

Knowing the truth about the vanishing did not\nlessen their opinion of Bilbo at all; for they saw that he had some wits, as\nwell as luck and a magic ring\u2014and all three are very useful possessions.

Still elves they were and\nremain, and that is Good People.\nIn a great cave some miles within the edge of Mirkwood on its eastern\nside there lived at this time their greatest king.

So to the cave they dragged\nThorin\u2014not too gently, for they did not love dwarves, and thought he was\nan enemy. In ancient days they had had wars with some of the dwarves,\nwhom they accused of stealing their treasure.

For Thorin had taken heart\nagain hearing how the hobbit had rescued his companions from the spiders,", "and was determined once more not to ransom himself with promises to the\nking of a share in the treasure, until all hope of escaping in any other way\nhad disappeared; until in fact the remarkable Mr. Invisible Baggins (of\nwhom he began to have a very high opinion indeed) had altogether failed to\nthink of something clever.\nThe other dwarves quite agreed when they got the message. They all\nthought their own shares in the treasure (which they quite regarded as\ntheirs, in spite of their plight and the still unconquered dragon) would suffer\nseriously if the Wood-elves claimed part of it, and they all trusted Bilbo.\nJust what Gandalf had said would happen, you see. Perhaps that was part of\nhis reason for going off and leaving them.\nBilbo, however, did not feel nearly so hopeful as they did. He did not\nlike being depended on by everyone, and he wished he had the wizard at\nhand. But that was no use: probably all the dark distance of Mirkwood lay", "like being depended on by everyone, and he wished he had the wizard at\nhand. But that was no use: probably all the dark distance of Mirkwood lay\nbetween them. He sat and thought and thought, until his head nearly burst,\nbut no bright idea would come. One invisible ring was a very fine thing, but\nit was not much good among fourteen. But of course, as you have guessed,\nhe did rescue his friends in the end, and this is how it happened.\nOne day, nosing and wandering about, Bilbo discovered a very\ninteresting thing: the great gates were not the only entrance to the caves. A\nstream flowed under part of the lowest regions of the palace, and joined the\nForest River some way further to the east, beyond the steep slope out of\nwhich the main mouth opened. Where this underground watercourse came\nforth from the hillside there was a water-gate. There the rocky roof came\ndown close to the surface of the stream, and from it a portcullis could be", "forth from the hillside there was a water-gate. There the rocky roof came\ndown close to the surface of the stream, and from it a portcullis could be\ndropped right to the bed of the river to prevent anyone coming in or out that\nway. But the portcullis was often open, for a good deal of traffic went out\nand in by the water-gate. If anyone had come in that way, he would have\nfound himself in a dark rough tunnel leading deep into the heart of the hill;\nbut at one point where it passed under the caves the roof had been cut away\nand covered with great oaken trapdoors. These opened upwards into the\nking\u2019s cellars. There stood barrels, and barrels, and barrels; for the Woodelves, and especially their king, were very fond of wine, though no vines\ngrew in those parts. The wine, and other goods, were brought from far\naway, from their kinsfolk in the South, or from the vineyards of Men in\ndistant lands.", "Hiding behind one of the largest barrels Bilbo discovered the trapdoors\nand their use, and lurking there, listening to the talk of the king\u2019s servants,\nhe learned how the wine and other goods came up the rivers, or over land,\nto the Long Lake. It seemed a town of Men still throve there, built out on\nbridges far into the water as a protection against enemies of all sorts, and\nespecially against the dragon of the Mountain. From Lake-town the barrels\nwere brought up the Forest River. Often they were just tied together like big\nrafts and poled or rowed up the stream; sometimes they were loaded on to\nflat boats.\nWhen the barrels were empty the elves cast them through the trapdoors,\nopened the water-gate, and out the barrels floated on the stream, bobbing\nalong, until they were carried by the current to a place far down the river\nwhere the bank jutted out, near to the very eastern edge of Mirkwood. There\nthey were collected and tied together and floated back to Lake-town, which", "where the bank jutted out, near to the very eastern edge of Mirkwood. There\nthey were collected and tied together and floated back to Lake-town, which\nstood close to the point where the Forest River flowed into the Long Lake.", "For some time Bilbo sat and thought about this water-gate, and wondered if\nit could be used for the escape of his friends, and at last he had the\ndesperate beginnings of a plan.\nThe evening meal had been taken to the prisoners. The guards were\ntramping away down the passages taking the torchlight with them and\nleaving everything in darkness. Then Bilbo heard the king\u2019s butler bidding\nthe chief of the guards good-night.\n\u201cNow come with me,\u201d he said, \u201cand taste the new wine that has just\ncome in. I shall be hard at work tonight clearing the cellars of the empty\nwood, so let us have a drink first to help the labour.\u201d\n\u201cVery good,\u201d laughed the chief of the guards. \u201cI\u2019ll taste with you, and\nsee if it is fit for the king\u2019s table. There is a feast tonight and it would not do\nto send up poor stuff!\u201d", "When he heard this Bilbo was all in a flutter, for he saw that luck was with\nhim and he had a chance at once to try his desperate plan. He followed the\ntwo elves, until they entered a small cellar and sat down at a table on which", "two large flagons were set. Soon they began to drink and laugh merrily.\nLuck of an unusual kind was with Bilbo then. It must be potent wine to\nmake a wood-elf drowsy; but this wine, it would seem, was the heady\nvintage of the great gardens of Dorwinion, not meant for his soldiers or his\nservants, but for the king\u2019s feasts only, and for smaller bowls not for the\nbutler\u2019s great flagons.\nVery soon the chief guard nodded his head, then he laid it on the table\nand fell fast asleep. The butler went on talking and laughing to himself for a\nwhile without seeming to notice, but soon his head too nodded to the table,\nand he fell asleep and snored beside his friend. Then in crept the hobbit.\nVery soon the chief guard had no keys, but Bilbo was trotting as fast as he\ncould along the passages towards the cells. The great bunch seemed very\nheavy to his arms, and his heart was often in his mouth, in spite of his ring,\nfor he could not prevent the keys from making every now and then a loud", "heavy to his arms, and his heart was often in his mouth, in spite of his ring,\nfor he could not prevent the keys from making every now and then a loud\nclink and clank, which put him all in a tremble.\nFirst he unlocked Balin\u2019s door, and locked it again carefully as soon as\nthe dwarf was outside. Balin was most surprised, as you can imagine; but\nglad as he was to get out of his wearisome little stone room, he wanted to\nstop and ask questions, and know what Bilbo was going to do, and all about\nit.\n\u201cNo time now!\u201d said the hobbit. \u201cYou just follow me! We must all keep\ntogether and not risk getting separated. All of us must escape or none, and\nthis is our last chance. If this is found out, goodness knows where the king\nwill put you next, with chains on your hands and feet too, I expect. Don\u2019t\nargue, there\u2019s a good fellow!\u201d\nThen off he went from door to door, until his following had grown to\ntwelve\u2014none of them any too nimble, what with the dark, and what with", "argue, there\u2019s a good fellow!\u201d\nThen off he went from door to door, until his following had grown to\ntwelve\u2014none of them any too nimble, what with the dark, and what with\ntheir long imprisonment. Bilbo\u2019s heart thumped every time one of them\nbumped into another, or grunted or whispered in the dark. \u201cDrat this\ndwarvish racket!\u201d he said to himself. But all went well, and they met no\nguards. As a matter of fact there was a great autumn feast in the woods that\nnight, and in the halls above. Nearly all the king\u2019s folk were merrymaking.\nAt last after much blundering they came to Thorin\u2019s dungeon, far down\nin a deep place and fortunately not far from the cellars.\n\u201cUpon my word!\u201d said Thorin, when Bilbo whispered to him to come\nout and join his friends, \u201cGandalf spoke true, as usual! A pretty fine burglar", "you make, it seems, when the time comes. I am sure we are all for ever at\nyour service, whatever happens after this. But what comes next?\u201d\nBilbo saw that the time had come to explain his idea, as far as he could;\nbut he did not feel at all sure how the dwarves would take it. His fears were\nquite justified, for they did not like it a bit, and started grumbling loudly in\nspite of their danger.\n\u201cWe shall be bruised and battered to pieces, and drowned too, for\ncertain!\u201d they muttered. \u201cWe thought you had got some sensible notion,\nwhen you managed to get hold of the keys. This is a mad idea!\u201d\n\u201cVery well!\u201d said Bilbo very downcast, and also rather annoyed. \u201cCome\nalong back to your nice cells, and I will lock you all in again, and you can\nsit there comfortably and think of a better plan\u2014but I don\u2019t suppose I shall\never get hold of the keys again, even if I feel inclined to try.\u201d\nThat was too much for them, and they calmed down. In the end, of", "ever get hold of the keys again, even if I feel inclined to try.\u201d\nThat was too much for them, and they calmed down. In the end, of\ncourse, they had to do just what Bilbo suggested, because it was obviously\nimpossible for them to try and find their way into the upper halls, or to fight\ntheir way out of gates that closed by magic; and it was no good grumbling\nin the passages until they were caught again. So following the hobbit, down\ninto the lowest cellars they crept. They passed a door through which the\nchief guard and the butler could be seen still happily snoring with smiles\nupon their faces. The wine of Dorwinion brings deep and pleasant dreams.\nThere would be a different expression on the face of the chief guard next\nday, even though Bilbo, before they went on, stole in and kind-heartedly put\nthe keys back on his belt.\n\u201cThat will save him some of the trouble he is in for,\u201d said Mr. Baggins\nto himself. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t a bad fellow, and quite decent to the prisoners.

We have got to get\nbusy very quick, if that is to happen!\u201d", "Balin was told off to watch the guard and the butler and give warning if\nthey stirred. The rest went into the adjoining cellar with the trapdoors.\nThere was little time to lose. Before long, as Bilbo knew, some elves were\nunder orders to come down and help the butler get the empty barrels", "through the doors into the stream. These were in fact already standing in\nrows in the middle of the floor waiting to be pushed off. Some of them were\nwine-barrels, and these were not much use, as they could not easily be\nopened at the end without a deal of noise, nor could they easily be secured\nagain. But among them were several others, which had been used for\nbringing other stuffs, butter, apples, and all sorts of things, to the king\u2019s\npalace.\nThey soon found thirteen with room enough for a dwarf in each. In fact\nsome were too roomy, and as they climbed in the dwarves thought\nanxiously of the shaking and the bumping they would get inside, though\nBilbo did his best to find straw and other stuff to pack them in as cosily as\ncould be managed in a short time. At last twelve dwarves were stowed.\nThorin had given a lot of trouble, and turned and twisted in his tub and\ngrumbled like a large dog in a small kennel; while Balin, who came last,", "Thorin had given a lot of trouble, and turned and twisted in his tub and\ngrumbled like a large dog in a small kennel; while Balin, who came last,\nmade a great fuss about his air-holes and said he was stifling, even before\nhis lid was on. Bilbo had done what he could to close holes in the sides of\nthe barrels, and to fix on all the lids as safely as could be managed, and now\nhe was left alone again, running round putting the finishing touches to the\npacking, and hoping against hope that his plan would come off.\nIt had not been done a bit too soon. Only a minute or two after Balin\u2019s\nlid had been fitted on there came the sound of voices and the flicker of\nlights. A number of elves came laughing and talking into the cellars and\nsinging snatches of song. They had left a merry feast in one of the halls and\nwere bent on returning as soon as they could.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s old Galion, the butler?\u201d said one. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen him at the", "singing snatches of song.

You have stacked some\nfull casks here instead of the empty ones, if there is anything in weight.\u201d\n\u201cGet on with the work!\u201d growled the butler. \u201cThere is nothing in the\nfeeling of weight in an idle toss-pot\u2019s arms.

Some had already\ngone to haul on the ropes which pulled up the portcullis at the water-gate so\nas to let out the barrels as soon as they were all afloat below.\nDown the swift dark stream you go\nBack to lands you once did know!\nLeave the halls and caverns deep,\nLeave the northern mountains steep,\nWhere the forest wide and dim\nStoops in shadow grey and grim!\nFloat beyond the world of trees\nOut into the whispering breeze,\nPast the rushes, past the reeds,", "Leave the northern mountains steep,\nWhere the forest wide and dim\nStoops in shadow grey and grim!\nFloat beyond the world of trees\nOut into the whispering breeze,\nPast the rushes, past the reeds,\nPast the marsh\u2019s waving weeds,\nThrough the mist that riseth white\nUp from mere and pool at night!\nFollow, follow stars that leap\nUp the heavens cold and steep;\nTurn when dawn comes over land,\nOver rapid, over sand,\nSouth away! and South away!\nSeek the sunlight and the day,\nBack to pasture, back to mead,\nWhere the kine and oxen feed!\nBack to gardens on the hills\nWhere the berry swells and fills\nUnder sunlight, under day!\nSouth away! and South away!", "Down the swift dark stream you go\nBack to lands you once did know!\nNow the very last barrel was being rolled to the doors!

He had as much as he could\ndo to prevent himself from being hustled and battered to bits; but at last the\njostling crowd began to break up and swing off, one by one, under the stony\narch and away.

Then Bilbo took the opportunity of scrambling up the\nside of his barrel while it was held steady against another. Up he crawled\nlike a drowned rat, and lay on the top spread out to keep the balance as best\nhe could.

All the same it was like trying to ride, without bridle or stirrups, a\nround-bellied pony that was always thinking of rolling on the grass.\nIn this way at last Mr. Baggins came to a place where the trees on either\nhand grew thinner. He could see the paler sky between them. The dark river\nopened suddenly wide, and there it was joined to the main water of the\nForest River flowing down in haste from the king\u2019s great doors.

This had a\nshingly shore under hanging banks and was walled at the eastern end by a\nlittle jutting cape of hard rock. On the shallow shore most of the barrels ran\naground, though a few went on to bump against the stony pier.\nThere were people on the look-out on the banks.

But Bilbo did not know it.\nAll he knew was that the river seemed to go on and on and on for ever,\nand he was hungry, and had a nasty cold in the nose, and did not like the\nway the Mountain seemed to frown at him and threaten him as it drew ever\nnearer.

It was so wide that the opposite shores looked small and\nfar, but it was so long that its northerly end, which pointed towards the\nMountain, could not be seen at all.

It was not built on the shore,\nthough there were a few huts and buildings there, but right out on the\nsurface of the lake, protected from the swirl of the entering river by a\npromontory of rock which formed a calm bay.

They did not know of course how\nThorin had escaped, and they began to think their king might have made a\nserious mistake. As for the Master he saw there was nothing else for it but\nto obey the general clamour, for the moment at any rate, and to pretend to\nbelieve that Thorin was what he said.

Thorin looked and walked as if his kingdom was already regained\nand Smaug chopped up into little pieces.\nThen, as he had said, the dwarves\u2019 good feeling towards the little hobbit\ngrew stronger every day. There were no more groans or grumbles. They", "drank his health, and they patted him on the back, and they made a great\nfuss of him; which was just as well, for he was not feeling particularly\ncheerful. He had not forgotten the look of the Mountain, nor the thought of\nthe dragon, and he had besides a shocking cold. For three days he sneezed\nand coughed, and he could not go out, and even after that his speeches at\nbanquets were limited to \u201cThag you very buch.\u201d", "In the meanwhile the Wood-elves had gone back up the Forest River with\ntheir cargoes, and there was great excitement in the king\u2019s palace. I have\nnever heard what happened to the chief of the guards and the butler.\nNothing of course was ever said about keys or barrels while the dwarves\nstayed in Lake-town, and Bilbo was careful never to become invisible. Still,\nI daresay, more was guessed than was known, though doubtless Mr.\nBaggins remained a bit of a mystery.

While the\nenthusiasm still lasted in the town was the time to get help. It would not do\nto let everything cool down with delay. So he spoke to the Master and his\ncouncillors and said that soon he and his company must go on towards the\nMountain.\nThen for the first time the Master was surprised and a little frightened;\nand he wondered if Thorin was after all really a descendant of the old kings.\nHe had never thought that the dwarves would actually dare to approach\nSmaug, but believed they were frauds who would sooner or later be", "He had never thought that the dwarves would actually dare to approach\nSmaug, but believed they were frauds who would sooner or later be\ndiscovered and be turned out.

Along this they could carry no bundles or packs, so narrow\nand breathless was it, with a fall of a hundred and fifty feet beside them on\nto sharp rocks below; but each of them took a good coil of rope wound tight\nabout his waist, and so at last without mishap they reached the little grassy\nbay.\nThere they made their third camp, hauling up what they needed from\nbelow with their ropes.

The others who were busy with the secret of the\ndoor had no more success. They were too eager to trouble about the runes\nor the moon-letters, but tried without resting to discover where exactly in\nthe smooth face of the rock the door was hidden.

He went to the opening and there pale and\nfaint was a thin new moon above the rim of Earth.\nAt that very moment he heard a sharp crack behind him. There on the\ngrey stone in the grass was an enormous thrush, nearly coal black, its pale\nyellow breast freckled with dark spots. Crack! It had caught a snail and was\nknocking it on the stone. Crack! Crack!\nSuddenly Bilbo understood. Forgetting all danger he stood on the ledge\nand hailed the dwarves, shouting and waving.

It sank into a belt of\nreddened cloud and disappeared. The dwarves groaned, but still Bilbo stood\nalmost without moving. The little moon was dipping to the horizon.\nEvening was coming on. Then suddenly when their hope was lowest a red\nray of the sun escaped like a finger through a rent in the cloud. A gleam of\nlight came straight through the opening into the bay and fell on the smooth\nrock-face.

He had never felt quite happy about it, though\nit was so small, and now he glared at it in suspicion and wondered why he\nhad never blocked it up.

When midday\ncame he got ready for another journey down into the Mountain. He did not\nlike it of course, but it was not so bad now he knew, more or less, what was\nin front of him. Had he known more about dragons and their wily ways, he", "like it of course, but it was not so bad now he knew, more or less, what was\nin front of him. Had he known more about dragons and their wily ways, he\nmight have been more frightened and less hopeful of catching this one\nnapping.\nThe sun was shining when he started, but it was as dark as night in the\ntunnel. The light from the door, almost closed, soon faded as he went down.\nSo silent was his going that smoke on a gentle wind could hardly have\nsurpassed it, and he was inclined to feel a bit proud of himself as he drew\nnear the lower door. There was only the very faintest glow to be seen.", "\u201cOld Smaug is weary and asleep,\u201d he thought. \u201cHe can\u2019t see me and he\nwon\u2019t hear me. Cheer up Bilbo!\u201d He had forgotten or had never heard about\ndragons\u2019 sense of smell. It is also an awkward fact that they can keep half\nan eye open watching while they sleep, if they are suspicious.\nSmaug certainly looked fast asleep, almost dead and dark, with scarcely\na snore more than a whiff of unseen steam, when Bilbo peeped once more\nfrom the entrance. He was just about to step out on to the floor when he\ncaught a sudden thin and piercing ray of red from under the drooping lid of\nSmaug\u2019s left eye. He was only pretending to sleep! He was watching the\ntunnel entrance! Hurriedly Bilbo stepped back and blessed the luck of his\nring. Then Smaug spoke.", "\u201cWell, thief! I smell you and I feel your air. I hear your breath. Come along!\nHelp yourself again, there is plenty and to spare!\u201d\nBut Bilbo was not quite so unlearned in dragon-lore as all that, and if\nSmaug hoped to get him to come nearer so easily he was disappointed. \u201cNo\nthank you, O Smaug the Tremendous!\u201d he replied.\n\u201cI did not come for presents. I only wished to have a look at you and see\nif you were truly as great as tales say. I did not believe them.\u201d\n\u201cDo you now?\u201d said the dragon somewhat flattered, even though he did\nnot believe a word of it.\n\u201cTruly songs and tales fall utterly short of the reality, O Smaug the\nChiefest and Greatest of Calamities,\u201d replied Bilbo.\n\u201cYou have nice manners for a thief and a liar,\u201d said the dragon. \u201cYou\nseem familiar with my name, but I don\u2019t seem to remember smelling you\nbefore. Who are you and where do you come from, may I ask?\u201d\n\u201cYou may indeed! I come from under the hill, and under the hills and", "seem familiar with my name, but I don\u2019t seem to remember smelling you\nbefore.

I am he that walks unseen.\u201d\n\u201cSo I can well believe,\u201d said Smaug, \u201cbut that is hardly your usual\nname.\u201d\n\u201cI am the clue-finder, the web-cutter, the stinging fly. I was chosen for\nthe lucky number.\u201d\n\u201cLovely titles!\u201d sneered the dragon. \u201cBut lucky numbers don\u2019t always\ncome off.\u201d", "\u201cI am he that buries his friends alive and drowns them and draws them\nalive again from the water. I came from the end of a bag, but no bag went\nover me.\u201d\n\u201cThese don\u2019t sound so creditable,\u201d scoffed Smaug. \u201cI am the friend of\nbears and the guest of eagles. I am Ringwinner and Luckwearer; and I am\nBarrel-rider,\u201d went on Bilbo beginning to be pleased with his riddling.\n\u201cThat\u2019s better!\u201d said Smaug. \u201cBut don\u2019t let your imagination run away\nwith you!\u201d", "This of course is the way to talk to dragons, if you don\u2019t want to reveal your\nproper name (which is wise), and don\u2019t want to infuriate them by a flat\nrefusal (which is also very wise). No dragon can resist the fascination of\nriddling talk and of wasting time trying to understand it. There was a lot\nhere which Smaug did not understand at all (though I expect you do, since\nyou know all about Bilbo\u2019s adventures to which he was referring), but he\nthought he understood enough, and he chuckled in his wicked inside.\n\u201cI thought so last night,\u201d he smiled to himself. \u201cLake-men, some nasty\nscheme of those miserable tub-trading Lake-men, or I\u2019m a lizard. I haven\u2019t\nbeen down that way for an age and an age; but I will soon alter that!\u201d\n\u201cVery well, O Barrel-rider!\u201d he said aloud. \u201cMaybe Barrel was your\npony\u2019s name; and maybe not, though it was fat enough.

I don\u2019t mind if you go\nback and tell them so from me.\u201d But he did not tell Bilbo that there was one\nsmell he could not make out at all, hobbit-smell; it was quite outside his\nexperience and puzzled him mightily.\n\u201cI suppose you got a fair price for that cup last night?\u201d he went on.\n\u201cCome now, did you? Nothing at all! Well, that\u2019s just like them.

Whenever Smaug\u2019s\nroving eye, seeking for him in the shadows, flashed across him, he\ntrembled, and an unaccountable desire seized hold of him to rush out and\nreveal himself and tell all the truth to Smaug. In fact he was in grievous\ndanger of coming under the dragon-spell. But plucking up courage he spoke\nagain.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know everything, O Smaug the Mighty,\u201d said he. \u201cNot gold\nalone brought us hither.\u201d\n\u201cHa! Ha!

In that case you may,\nperhaps, not altogether waste your time.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if it has occurred to you that, even if you could steal the\ngold bit by bit\u2014a matter of a hundred years or so\u2014you could not get it\nvery far?

What about cartage? What about armed guards and tolls?\u201d And\nSmaug laughed aloud. He had a wicked and a wily heart, and he knew his\nguesses were not far out, though he suspected that the Lake-men were at the\nback of the plans, and that most of the plunder was meant to stop there in\nthe town by the shore that in his young days had been called Esgaroth.\nYou will hardly believe it, but poor Bilbo was really very taken aback.\nSo far all his thoughts and energies had been concentrated on getting to the\nMountain and finding the entrance.

That is the effect that dragon-talk has on the\ninexperienced. Bilbo of course ought to have been on his guard; but Smaug\nhad rather an overwhelming personality.\n\u201cI tell you,\u201d he said, in an effort to remain loyal to his friends and to\nkeep his end up, \u201cthat gold was only an afterthought with us. We came over\nhill and under hill, by wave and wind, for Revenge. Surely, O Smaug the\nunassessably wealthy, you must realize that your success has made you\nsome bitter enemies?\u201d\nThen Smaug really did laugh\u2014a devastating sound which shook Bilbo\nto the floor, while far up in the tunnel the dwarves huddled together and\nimagined that the hobbit had come to a sudden and a nasty end.\n\u201cRevenge!\u201d he snorted, and the light of his eyes lit the hall from floor to\nceiling like scarlet lightning. \u201cRevenge!

What magnificence to\npossess a waistcoat of fine diamonds!\u201d\n\u201cYes, it is rare and wonderful, indeed,\u201d said Smaug absurdly pleased. He\ndid not know that the hobbit had already caught a glimpse of his peculiar\nunder-covering on his previous visit, and was itching for a closer view for", "reasons of his own.

Ponies take some catching, I believe, after a long\nstart. And so do burglars,\u201d he added as a parting shot, as he darted back and\nfled up the tunnel.\nIt was an unfortunate remark, for the dragon spouted terrific flames after\nhim, and fast though he sped up the slope, he had not gone nearly far\nenough to be comfortable before the ghastly head of Smaug was thrust\nagainst the opening behind. Luckily the whole head and jaws could not\nsqueeze in, but the nostrils sent forth fire and vapour to pursue him, and he", "against the opening behind.

On thinking things over he was now\nregretting some of the things he had said to the dragon, and was not eager to", "repeat them.

So for a longish while they\nsat inside not far down from the half-open door and went on talking.\nThe talk turned to the dragon\u2019s wicked words about the dwarves. Bilbo\nwished he had never heard them, or at least that he could feel quite certain\nthat the dwarves now were absolutely honest when they declared that they\nhad never thought at all about what would happen after the treasure had\nbeen won. \u201cWe knew it would be a desperate venture,\u201d said Thorin, \u201cand\nwe know that still; and I still think that when we have won it will be time", "enough to think what to do about it.

They wondered if they were still lying there\nunharmed in the hall below: the spears that were made for the armies of the\ngreat King Bladorthin (long since dead), each had a thrice-forged head and\ntheir shafts were inlaid with cunning gold, but they were never delivered or\npaid for; shields made for warriors long dead; the great golden cup of Thror,", "their shafts were inlaid with cunning gold, but they were never delivered or\npaid for; shields made for warriors long dead; the great golden cup of Thror,\ntwo-handed, hammered and carven with birds and flowers whose eyes and\npetals were of jewels; coats of mail gilded and silvered and impenetrable;\nthe necklace of Girion, Lord of Dale, made of five hundred emeralds green\nas grass, which he gave for the arming of his eldest son in a coat of dwarflinked rings the like of which had never been made before, for it was\nwrought of pure silver to the power and strength of triple steel. But fairest\nof all was the great white gem, which the dwarves had found beneath the\nroots of the Mountain, the Heart of the Mountain, the Arkenstone of Thrain.\n\u201cThe Arkenstone! The Arkenstone!\u201d murmured Thorin in the dark, half\ndreaming with his chin upon his knees. \u201cIt was like a globe with a thousand\nfacets; it shone like silver in the firelight, like water in the sun, like snow", "dreaming with his chin upon his knees. \u201cIt was like a globe with a thousand\nfacets; it shone like silver in the firelight, like water in the sun, like snow\nunder the stars, like rain upon the Moon!\u201d\nBut the enchanted desire of the hoard had fallen from Bilbo. All through\ntheir talk he was only half listening to them. He sat nearest to the door with\none ear cocked for any beginnings of a sound without, his other was alert\nfor echoes beyond the murmurs of the dwarves, for any whisper of a\nmovement from far below.\nDarkness grew deeper and he grew ever more uneasy. \u201cShut the door!\u201d\nhe begged them, \u201cI fear that dragon in my marrow. I like this silence far less\nthan the uproar of last night. Shut the door before it is too late!\u201d\nSomething in his voice gave the dwarves an uncomfortable feeling.\nSlowly Thorin shook off his dreams and getting up he kicked away the\nstone that wedged the door. Then they thrust upon it, and it closed with a", "snap and a clang. No trace of a keyhole was there left on the inside. They\nwere shut in the Mountain!\nAnd not a moment too soon. They had hardly gone any distance down\nthe tunnel when a blow smote the side of the Mountain like the crash of\nbattering-rams made of forest oaks and swung by giants. The rock boomed,\nthe walls cracked and stones fell from the roof on their heads. What would\nhave happened if the door had still been open I don\u2019t like to think.

He was breaking rocks to\npieces, smashing wall and cliff with the lashings of his huge tail, till their\nlittle lofty camping ground, the scorched grass, the thrush\u2019s stone, the snailcovered walls, the narrow ledge, and all disappeared in a jumble of\nsmithereens, and an avalanche of splintered stones fell over the cliff into the\nvalley below.", "smithereens, and an avalanche of splintered stones fell over the cliff into the\nvalley below.\nSmaug had left his lair in silent stealth, quietly soared into the air, and\nthen floated heavy and slow in the dark like a monstrous crow, down the\nwind towards the west of the Mountain, in the hopes of catching unawares\nsomething or somebody there, and of spying the outlet to the passage which\nthe thief had used. This was the outburst of his wrath when he could find\nnobody and see nothing, even where he guessed the outlet must actually be.\nAfter he had let off his rage in this way he felt better and he thought in\nhis heart that he would not be troubled again from that direction. In the\nmeanwhile he had further vengeance to take. \u201cBarrel-rider!\u201d he snorted.\n\u201cYour feet came from the waterside and up the water you came without a\ndoubt.

Little they ate and little they spoke. They could not count the passing\nof time; and they scarcely dared to move, for the whisper of their voices\nechoed and rustled in the tunnel. If they dozed, they woke still to darkness\nand to silence going on unbroken. At last after days and days of waiting, as\nit seemed, when they were becoming choked and dazed for want of air, they\ncould bear it no longer. They would almost have welcomed sounds from\nbelow of the dragon\u2019s return. In the silence they feared some cunning\ndevilry of his, but they could not sit there for ever.\nThorin spoke: \u201cLet us try the door!\u201d he said. \u201cI must feel the wind on\nmy face soon or die.

And I think this time you had better all come with\nme.\u201d\nIn desperation they agreed, and Thorin was the first to go forward by\nBilbo\u2019s side.\n\u201cNow do be careful!\u201d whispered the hobbit, \u201cand as quiet as you can be!\nThere may be no Smaug at the bottom, but then again there may be. Don\u2019t\nlet us take any unnecessary risks!\u201d\nDown, down they went. The dwarves could not, of course, compare with\nthe hobbit in real stealth, and they made a deal of puffing and shuffling\nwhich echoes magnified alarmingly; but though every now and again Bilbo\nin fear stopped and listened, not a sound stirred below. Near the bottom, as\nwell as he could judge, Bilbo slipped on his ring and went ahead. But he did\nnot need it: the darkness was complete, and they were all invisible, ring or\nno ring. In fact so black was it that the hobbit came to the opening\nunexpectedly, put his hand on air, stumbled forward, and rolled headlong\ninto the hall!", "no ring. In fact so black was it that the hobbit came to the opening\nunexpectedly, put his hand on air, stumbled forward, and rolled headlong\ninto the hall!\nThere he lay face downwards on the floor and did not dare to get up, or\nhardly even to breathe. But nothing moved. There was not a gleam of light\n\u2014unless, as it seemed to him, when at last he slowly raised his head, there\nwas a pale white glint, above him and far off in the gloom. But certainly it\nwas not a spark of dragon-fire, though the worm-stench was heavy in the\nplace, and the taste of vapour was on his tongue.\nAt length Mr. Baggins could bear it no longer. \u201cConfound you, Smaug,\nyou worm!\u201d he squeaked aloud. \u201cStop playing hide-and-seek! Give me a\nlight, and then eat me, if you can catch me!\u201d\nFaint echoes ran round the unseen hall, but there was no answer.\nBilbo got up, and found that he did not know in what direction to turn.\n\u201cNow I wonder what on earth Smaug is playing at,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is not", "Bilbo got up, and found that he did not know in what direction to turn.\n\u201cNow I wonder what on earth Smaug is playing at,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is not\nat home today (or tonight, or whatever it is), I do believe. If Oin and Gloin\nhave not lost their tinder-boxes, perhaps we can make a little light, and have\na look round before the luck turns.\u201d\n\u201cLight!\u201d he cried. \u201cCan anybody make a light?\u201d", "The dwarves, of course, were very alarmed when Bilbo fell forward down\nthe step with a bump into the hall, and they sat huddled just where he had\nleft them at the end of the tunnel.\n\u201cSh! sh!\u201d they hissed, when they heard his voice; and though that helped\nthe hobbit to find out where they were, it was some time before he could get\nanything else out of them. But in the end, when Bilbo actually began to\nstamp on the floor, and screamed out \u201clight!\u201d at the top of his shrill voice,\nThorin gave way, and Oin and Gloin were sent back to their bundles at the\ntop of the tunnel.\nAfter a while a twinkling gleam showed them returning, Oin with a\nsmall pine-torch alight in his hand, and Gloin with a bundle of others under\nhis arm. Quickly Bilbo trotted to the door and took the torch; but he could\nnot persuade the dwarves to light the others or to come and join him yet. As\nThorin carefully explained, Mr. Baggins was still officially their expert", "not persuade the dwarves to light the others or to come and join him yet. As\nThorin carefully explained, Mr. Baggins was still officially their expert\nburglar and investigator. If he liked to risk a light, that was his affair. They\nwould wait in the tunnel for his report. So they sat near the door and\nwatched.\nThey saw the little dark shape of the hobbit start across the floor holding\nhis tiny light aloft. Every now and again, while he was still near enough,\nthey caught a glint and a tinkle as he stumbled on some golden thing. The\nlight grew smaller as he wandered away into the vast hall; then it began to\nrise dancing into the air. Bilbo was climbing the great mound of treasure.\nSoon he stood upon the top, and still went on. Then they saw him halt and\nstoop for a moment; but they did not know the reason.\nIt was the Arkenstone, the Heart of the Mountain. So Bilbo guessed\nfrom Thorin\u2019s description; but indeed there could not be two such gems,", "stoop for a moment; but they did not know the reason.\nIt was the Arkenstone, the Heart of the Mountain. So Bilbo guessed\nfrom Thorin\u2019s description; but indeed there could not be two such gems,\neven in so marvellous a hoard, even in all the world. Ever as he climbed,\nthe same white gleam had shone before him and drawn his feet towards it.\nSlowly it grew to a little globe of pallid light. Now as he came near, it was\ntinged with a flickering sparkle of many colours at the surface, reflected and\nsplintered from the wavering light of his torch. At last he looked down upon\nit, and he caught his breath. The great jewel shone before his feet of its own\ninner light, and yet, cut and fashioned by the dwarves, who had dug it from\nthe heart of the mountain long ago, it took all light that fell upon it and\nchanged it into ten thousand sparks of white radiance shot with glints of the\nrainbow.", "Suddenly Bilbo\u2019s arm went towards it drawn by its enchantment. His\nsmall hand would not close about it, for it was a large and heavy gem; but\nhe lifted it, shut his eyes, and put it in his deepest pocket.\n\u201cNow I am a burglar indeed!\u201d thought he. \u201cBut I suppose I must tell the\ndwarves about it\u2014some time. They did say I could pick and choose my\nown share; and I think I would choose this, if they took all the rest!\u201d All the\nsame he had an uncomfortable feeling that the picking and choosing had not\nreally been meant to include this marvellous gem, and that trouble would\nyet come of it.\nNow he went on again. Down the other side of the great mound he\nclimbed, and the spark of his torch vanished from the sight of the watching\ndwarves. But soon they saw it far away in the distance again. Bilbo was\ncrossing the floor of the hall.\nHe went on, until he came to the great doors at the further side, and there\na draught of air refreshed him, but it almost puffed out his light. He peeped", "crossing the floor of the hall.\nHe went on, until he came to the great doors at the further side, and there\na draught of air refreshed him, but it almost puffed out his light. He peeped\ntimidly through, and caught a glimpse of great passages and of the dim\nbeginnings of wide stairs going up into the gloom. And still there was no\nsight nor sound of Smaug. He was just going to turn and go back, when a\nblack shape swooped at him, and brushed his face. He squeaked and started,\nstumbled backwards and fell. His torch dropped head downwards and went\nout!\n\u201cOnly a bat, I suppose and hope!\u201d he said miserably. \u201cBut now what am\nI to do? Which is East, South, North, or West?\u201d\n\u201cThorin! Balin! Oin! Gloin! Fili! Kili!\u201d he cried as loud as he could\u2014it\nseemed a thin little noise in the wide blackness. \u201cThe light\u2019s gone out!\nSomeone come and find me and help me!\u201d For the moment his courage had\nfailed altogether.\nFaintly the dwarves heard his small cries, though the only word they\ncould catch was \u201chelp!\u201d", "Someone come and find me and help me!\u201d For the moment his courage had\nfailed altogether.\nFaintly the dwarves heard his small cries, though the only word they\ncould catch was \u201chelp!\u201d\n\u201cNow what on earth or under it has happened?\u201d said Thorin. \u201cCertainly\nnot the dragon, or he would not go on squeaking.\u201d\nThey waited a moment or two, and still there were no dragon-noises, no\nsound at all in fact but Bilbo\u2019s distant voice. \u201cCome, one of you, get another\nlight or two!\u201d Thorin ordered. \u201cIt seems we have got to go and help our\nburglar.\u201d", "\u201cIt is about our turn to help,\u201d said Balin, \u201cand I am quite willing to go.\nAnyway I expect it is safe for the moment.\u201d\nGloin lit several more torches, and then they all crept out, one by one,\nand went along the wall as hurriedly as they could. It was not long before\nthey met Bilbo himself coming back towards them. His wits had quickly\nreturned as soon as he saw the twinkle of their lights.\n\u201cOnly a bat and a dropped torch, nothing worse!\u201d he said in answer to\ntheir questions. Though they were much relieved, they were inclined to be\ngrumpy at being frightened for nothing; but what they would have said, if\nhe had told them at that moment about the Arkenstone, I don\u2019t know. The\nmere fleeting glimpses of treasure which they had caught as they went\nalong had rekindled all the fire of their dwarvish hearts; and when the heart\nof a dwarf, even the most respectable, is wakened by gold and by jewels, he\ngrows suddenly bold, and he may become fierce.", "of a dwarf, even the most respectable, is wakened by gold and by jewels, he\ngrows suddenly bold, and he may become fierce.\nThe dwarves indeed no longer needed any urging. All were now eager to\nexplore the hall while they had the chance, and willing to believe that, for\nthe present, Smaug was away from home. Each now gripped a lighted\ntorch; and as they gazed, first on one side and then on another, they forgot\nfear and even caution. They spoke aloud, and cried out to one another, as\nthey lifted old treasures from the mound or from the wall and held them in\nthe light, caressing and fingering them.\nFili and Kili were almost in merry mood, and finding still hanging there\nmany golden harps strung with silver they took them and struck them; and\nbeing magical (and also untouched by the dragon, who had small interest in\nmusic) they were still in tune. The dark hall was filled with a melody that\nhad long been silent. But most of the dwarves were more practical: they", "music) they were still in tune. The dark hall was filled with a melody that\nhad long been silent. But most of the dwarves were more practical: they\ngathered gems and stuffed their pockets, and let what they could not carry\nfall back through their fingers with a sigh. Thorin was not least among\nthese; but always he searched from side to side for something which he\ncould not find. It was the Arkenstone; but he spoke of it yet to no one.\nNow the dwarves took down mail and weapons from the walls, and\narmed themselves. Royal indeed did Thorin look, clad in a coat of goldplated rings, with a silver-hafted axe in a belt crusted with scarlet stones.\n\u201cMr. Baggins!\u201d he cried. \u201cHere is the first payment of your reward! Cast\noff your old coat and put on this!\u201d", "With that he put on Bilbo a small coat of mail, wrought for some young\nelf-prince long ago. It was of silver-steel, which the elves call mithril, and\nwith it went a belt of pearls and crystals. A light helm of figured leather,\nstrengthened beneath with hoops of steel, and studded about the brim with\nwhite gems, was set upon the hobbit\u2019s head.\n\u201cI feel magnificent,\u201d he thought; \u201cbut I expect I look rather absurd. How\nthey would laugh on the Hill at home! Still I wish there was a looking-glass\nhandy!\u201d\nAll the same Mr. Baggins kept his head more clear of the bewitchment\nof the hoard than the dwarves did. Long before the dwarves were tired of\nexamining the treasures, he became weary of it and sat down on the floor;\nand he began to wonder nervously what the end of it all would be. \u201cI would\ngive a good many of these precious goblets,\u201d he thought, \u201cfor a drink of\nsomething cheering out of one of Beorn\u2019s wooden bowls!\u201d\n\u201cThorin!\u201d he cried aloud. \u201cWhat next?

We are armed, but what good has\nany armour ever been before against Smaug the Dreadful? This treasure is\nnot yet won back. We are not looking for gold yet, but for a way of escape;\nand we have tempted luck too long!\u201d\n\u201cYou speak the truth!\u201d answered Thorin, recovering his wits. \u201cLet us go!\nI will guide you. Not in a thousand years should I forget the ways of this\npalace.\u201d Then he hailed the others, and they gathered together, and holding\ntheir torches above their heads they passed through the gaping doors, not\nwithout many a backward glance of longing.\nTheir glittering mail they had covered again with their old cloaks and\ntheir bright helms with their tattered hoods, and one by one they walked\nbehind Thorin, a line of little lights in the darkness that halted often,", "their bright helms with their tattered hoods, and one by one they walked\nbehind Thorin, a line of little lights in the darkness that halted often,\nlistening in fear once more for any rumour of the dragon\u2019s coming.\nThough all the old adornments were long mouldered or destroyed, and\nthough all was befouled and blasted with the comings and goings of the\nmonster, Thorin knew every passage and every turn. They climbed long\nstairs, and turned and went down wide echoing ways, and turned again and\nclimbed yet more stairs, and yet more stairs again. These were smooth, cut\nout of the living rock broad and fair; and up, up, the dwarves went, and they\nmet no sign of any living thing, only furtive shadows that fled from the\napproach of their torches fluttering in the draughts.", "The steps were not made, all the same, for hobbit-legs, and Bilbo was\njust feeling that he could go on no longer, when suddenly the roof sprang\nhigh and far beyond the reach of their torch-light. A white glimmer could be\nseen coming through some opening far above, and the air smelt sweeter.\nBefore them light came dimly through great doors, that hung twisted on\ntheir hinges and half burnt.\n\u201cThis is the great chamber of Thror,\u201d said Thorin; \u201cthe hall of feasting\nand of council. Not far off now is the Front Gate.\u201d\nThey passed through the ruined chamber. Tables were rotting there;\nchairs and benches were lying there overturned, charred and decaying.\nSkulls and bones were upon the floor among flagons and bowls and broken\ndrinking-horns and dust. As they came through yet more doors at the further\nend, a sound of water fell upon their ears, and the grey light grew suddenly\nmore full.\n\u201cThere is the birth of the Running River,\u201d said Thorin. \u201cFrom here it", "end, a sound of water fell upon their ears, and the grey light grew suddenly\nmore full.\n\u201cThere is the birth of the Running River,\u201d said Thorin. \u201cFrom here it\nhastens to the Gate. Let us follow it!\u201d\nOut of a dark opening in a wall of rock there issued a boiling water, and\nit flowed swirling in a narrow channel, carved and made straight and deep\nby the cunning of ancient hands. Beside it ran a stone-paved road, wide\nenough for many men abreast. Swiftly along this they ran, and round a\nwide-sweeping turn\u2014and behold! before them stood the broad light of day.\nIn front there rose a tall arch, still showing the fragments of old carven\nwork within, worn and splintered and blackened though it was. A misty sun\nsent its pale light between the arms of the Mountain, and beams of gold fell\non the pavement at the threshold.\nA whirl of bats frightened from slumber by their smoking torches\nflurried over them; as they sprang forward their feet slithered on stones", "on the pavement at the threshold.\nA whirl of bats frightened from slumber by their smoking torches\nflurried over them; as they sprang forward their feet slithered on stones\nrubbed smooth and slimed by the passing of the dragon. Now before them\nthe water fell noisily outward and foamed down towards the valley. They\nflung their pale torches to the ground, and stood gazing out with dazzled\neyes. They were come to the Front Gate, and were looking out upon Dale.\n\u201cWell!\u201d said Bilbo, \u201cI never expected to be looking out of this door. And\nI never expected to be so pleased to see the sun again, and to feel the wind\non my face. But, ow! this wind is cold!\u201d\nIt was. A bitter easterly breeze blew with a threat of oncoming winter. It\nswirled over and round the arms of the Mountain into the valley, and sighed", "among the rocks. After their long time in the stewing depths of the dragonhaunted caverns, they shivered in the sun.\nSuddenly Bilbo realized that he was not only tired but also very hungry\nindeed. \u201cIt seems to be late morning,\u201d he said, \u201cand so I suppose it is more\nor less breakfast-time\u2014if there is any breakfast to have.

At that point there was once a bridge, leading to steep stairs that", "down there! The river loops suddenly east across Dale in front of the ruined\ntown. At that point there was once a bridge, leading to steep stairs that\nclimbed up the right bank, and so to a road running towards Ravenhill.\nThere is (or was) a path that left the road and climbed up to the post. A hard\nclimb, too, even if the old steps are still there.\u201d\n\u201cDear me!\u201d grumbled the hobbit. \u201cMore walking and more climbing\nwithout breakfast! I wonder how many breakfasts, and other meals, we have\nmissed inside that nasty clockless, timeless hole?\u201d\nAs a matter of fact two nights and the day between had gone by (and not\naltogether without food) since the dragon smashed the magic door, but\nBilbo had quite lost count, and it might have been one night or a week of\nnights for all he could tell.\n\u201cCome, come!\u201d said Thorin laughing\u2014his spirits had begun to rise\nagain, and he rattled the precious stones in his pockets. \u201cDon\u2019t call my\npalace a nasty hole!

(If you want to\nknow what cram is, I can only say that I don\u2019t know the recipe; but it is\nbiscuitish, keeps good indefinitely, is supposed to be sustaining, and is\ncertainly not entertaining, being in fact very uninteresting except as a\nchewing exercise.

At length they reached the hill path. It scrambled steeply\nup, and they plodded slowly one behind the other, till at last in the late\nafternoon they came to the top of the ridge and saw the wintry sun going\ndownwards to the West.\nHere they found a flat place without a wall on three sides, but backed to\nthe North by a rocky face in which there was an opening like a door. From\nthat door there was a wide view East and South and West.\n\u201cHere,\u201d said Balin, \u201cin the old days we used always to keep watchmen,\nand that door behind leads into a rockhewn chamber that was made here as\na guardroom.

He circled for a while high in the air\nabove them lighting all the lake; the trees by the shores shone like copper\nand like blood with leaping shadows of dense black at their feet. Then down", "he swooped straight through the arrow-storm, reckless in his rage, taking no\nheed to turn his scaly sides towards his foes, seeking only to set their town\nablaze.\nFire leaped from thatched roofs and wooden beam-ends as he hurtled\ndown and past and round again, though all had been drenched with water\nbefore he came. Once more water was flung by a hundred hands wherever a\nspark appeared. Back swirled the dragon. A sweep of his tail and the roof of\nthe Great House crumbled and smashed down. Flames unquenchable sprang\nhigh into the night. Another swoop and another, and another house and then\nanother sprang afire and fell; and still no arrow hindered Smaug or hurt him\nmore than a fly from the marshes.", "Already men were jumping into the water on every side. Women and\nchildren were being huddled into laden boats in the market-pool. Weapons\nwere flung down. There was mourning and weeping, where but a little time\nago the old songs of mirth to come had been sung about the dwarves. Now\nmen cursed their names. The Master himself was turning to his great gilded\nboat, hoping to row away in the confusion and save himself. Soon all the\ntown would be deserted and burned down to the surface of the lake.\nThat was the dragon\u2019s hope. They could all get into boats for all he\ncared. There he could have fine sport hunting them, or they could stop till\nthey starved. Let them try to get to land and he would be ready. Soon he\nwould set all the shoreland woods ablaze and wither every field and pasture.\nJust now he was enjoying the sport of town-baiting more than he had\nenjoyed anything for years.\nBut there was still a company of archers that held their ground among", "Just now he was enjoying the sport of town-baiting more than he had\nenjoyed anything for years.\nBut there was still a company of archers that held their ground among\nthe burning houses.

He was a descendant in long line\nof Girion, Lord of Dale, whose wife and child had escaped down the\nRunning River from the ruin long ago. Now he shot with a great yew bow,\ntill all his arrows but one were spent. The flames were near him. His\ncompanions were leaving him. He bent his bow for the last time.", "Suddenly out of the dark something fluttered to his shoulder. He started\n\u2014but it was only an old thrush. Unafraid it perched by his ear and it\nbrought him news. Marvelling he found he could understand its tongue, for\nhe was of the race of Dale.\n\u201cWait! Wait!\u201d it said to him. \u201cThe moon is rising. Look for the hollow of\nthe left breast as he flies and turns above you!\u201d And while Bard paused in\nwonder it told him of tidings up in the Mountain and of all that it had heard.\nThen Bard drew his bow-string to his ear. The dragon was circling back,\nflying low, and as he came the moon rose above the eastern shore and\nsilvered his great wings.\n\u201cArrow!\u201d said the bowman. \u201cBlack arrow! I have saved you to the last.\nYou have never failed me and always I have recovered you. I had you from\nmy father and he from of old.

The great bow twanged. The black arrow sped\nstraight from the string, straight for the hollow by the left breast where the\nforeleg was flung wide. In it smote and vanished, barb, shaft and feather, so\nfierce was its flight. With a shriek that deafened men, felled trees and split\nstone, Smaug shot spouting into the air, turned over and crashed down from\non high in ruin.\nFull on the town he fell. His last throes splintered it to sparks and gledes.\nThe lake roared in. A vast steam leaped up, white in the sudden dark under\nthe moon. There was a hiss, a gushing whirl, and then silence. And that was\nthe end of Smaug and Esgaroth, but not of Bard.", "The waxing moon rose higher and higher and the wind grew loud and cold.\nIt twisted the white fog into bending pillars and hurrying clouds and drove\nit off to the West to scatter in tattered shreds over the marshes before\nMirkwood. Then the many boats could be seen dotted dark on the surface of\nthe lake, and down the wind came the voices of the people of Esgaroth\nlamenting their lost town and goods and ruined houses.

But, why O People?\u201d\u2014and here the Master rose\nto his feet and spoke very loud and clear\u2014\u201cWhy do I get all your blame?", "For what fault am I to be deposed? Who aroused the dragon from his\nslumber, I might ask? Who obtained of us rich gifts and ample help, and led\nus to believe that old songs could come true?

From whom should we claim the\nrecompense of our damage, and aid for our widows and orphans?\u201d\nAs you see, the Master had not got his position for nothing. The result of\nhis words was that for the moment the people quite forgot their idea of a\nnew king, and turned their angry thoughts towards Thorin and his company.\nWild and bitter words were shouted from many sides; and some of those\nwho had before sung the old songs loudest, were now heard as loudly\ncrying that the dwarves had stirred the dragon up against them deliberately!\n\u201cFools!\u201d said Bard. \u201cWhy waste words and wrath on those unhappy", "crying that the dwarves had stirred the dragon up against them deliberately!\n\u201cFools!\u201d said Bard. \u201cWhy waste words and wrath on those unhappy\ncreatures? Doubtless they perished first in fire, before Smaug came to us.\u201d\nThen even as he was speaking, the thought came into his heart of the fabled\ntreasure of the Mountain lying without guard or owner, and he fell suddenly\nsilent. He thought of the Master\u2019s words, and of Dale rebuilt, and filled with\ngolden bells, if he could but find the men.\nAt length he spoke again: \u201cThis is no time for angry words, Master, or\nfor considering weighty plans of change. There is work to do. I serve you\nstill\u2014though after a while I may think again of your words and go North\nwith any that will follow me.\u201d\nThen he strode off to help in the ordering of the camps and in the care of\nthe sick and the wounded.

He thought much but said little, unless\nit was to call loudly for men to bring him fire and food.\nNow everywhere Bard went he found talk running like fire among the\npeople concerning the vast treasure that was now unguarded. Men spoke of\nthe recompense for all their harm that they would soon get from it, and\nwealth over and to spare with which to buy rich things from the South; and\nit cheered them greatly in their plight. That was as well, for the night was\nbitter and miserable. Shelters could be contrived for few (the Master had\none) and there was little food (even the Master went short). Many took ill of\nwet and cold and sorrow that night, and afterwards died, who had escaped\nuninjured from the ruin of the town; and in the days that followed there was\nmuch sickness and great hunger.", "Meanwhile Bard took the lead, and ordered things as he wished, though\nalways in the Master\u2019s name, and he had a hard task to govern the people\nand direct the preparations for their protection and housing. Probably most\nof them would have perished in the winter that now hurried after autumn, if\nhelp had not been to hand. But help came swiftly; for Bard at once had\nspeedy messengers sent up the river to the Forest to ask the aid of the King\nof the Elves of the Wood, and these messengers had found a host already on\nthe move, although it was then only the third day after the fall of Smaug.\nThe Elvenking had received news from his own messengers and from\nthe birds that loved his folk, and already knew much of what had happened.\nVery great indeed was the commotion among all things with wings that\ndwelt on the borders of the Desolation of the Dragon.

Even before the Elvenking rode forth\nthe news had passed west right to the pinewoods of the Misty Mountains;\nBeorn had heard it in his wooden house, and the goblins were at council in\ntheir caves.\n\u201cThat will be the last we shall hear of Thorin Oakenshield, I fear,\u201d said\nthe king. \u201cHe would have done better to have remained my guest. It is an ill\nwind, all the same,\u201d he added, \u201cthat blows no one any good.\u201d For he too had\nnot forgotten the legend of the wealth of Thror.

He had not boats or rafts enough for his host, and they were\nforced to go the slower way by foot; but great store of goods he sent ahead\nby water. Still elves are light-footed, and though they were not in these days\nmuch used to the marches and the treacherous lands between the Forest and\nthe Lake, their going was swift. Only five days after the death of the dragon\nthey came upon the shores and looked on the ruins of the town. Their", "welcome was good, as may be expected, and the men and their Master were\nready to make any bargain for the future in return for the Elvenking\u2019s aid.\nTheir plans were soon made. With the women and the children, the old\nand the unfit, the Master remained behind; and with him were some men of\ncrafts and many skilled elves; and they busied themselves felling trees, and\ncollecting the timber sent down from the Forest. Then they set about raising\nmany huts by the shore against the oncoming winter; and also under the\nMaster\u2019s direction they began the planning of a new town, designed more\nfair and large even than before, but not in the same place. They removed\nnorthward higher up the shore; for ever after they had a dread of the water\nwhere the dragon lay. He would never again return to his golden bed, but\nwas stretched cold as stone, twisted upon the floor of the shallows.

There\nfor ages his huge bones could be seen in calm weather amid the ruined piles\nof the old town.

It was thus\nthat in eleven days from the ruin of the town the head of their host passed\nthe rock-gates at the end of the lake and came into the desolate lands.", "Chapter XV\nTHE GATHERING OF THE CLOUDS\nNow we will return to Bilbo and the dwarves.

They explored the caverns once more, and\nfound, as they expected, that only the Front Gate remained open; all the\nother gates (except, of course, the small secret door) had long ago been\nbroken and blocked by Smaug, and no sign of them remained. So now they\nbegan to labour hard in fortifying the main entrance, and in making a new\npath that led from it. Tools were to be found in plenty that the miners and\nquarriers and builders of old had used; and at such work the dwarves were\nstill very skilled.\nAs they worked the ravens brought them constant tidings. In this way\nthey learned that the Elvenking had turned aside to the Lake, and they still\nhad a breathing space. Better still, they heard that three of their ponies had\nescaped and were wandering wild far down the banks of the Running River,\nnot far from where the rest of their stores had been left.

There\nwere holes in the wall through which they could see (or shoot), but no\nentrance. They climbed in or out with ladders, and hauled stuff up with\nropes. For the issuing of the stream they had contrived a small low arch\nunder the new wall; but near the entrance they had so altered the narrow", "bed that a wide pool stretched from the mountain-wall to the head of the fall\nover which the stream went towards Dale. Approach to the Gate was now\nonly possible, without swimming, along a narrow ledge of the cliff, to the\nright as one looked outwards from the wall.

The morning was still pale when they\nsaw a company approaching. From behind their wall they watched them\ncome up to the valley\u2019s head and climb slowly up. Before long they could\nsee that both men of the lake armed as if for war and elvish bowmen were\namong them. At length the foremost of these climbed the tumbled rocks and\nappeared at the top of the falls; and very great was their surprise to see the\npool before them and the Gate blocked with a wall of new-hewn stone.\nAs they stood pointing and speaking to one another Thorin hailed them:\n\u201cWho are you,\u201d he called in a very loud voice, \u201cthat come as if in war to the\ngates of Thorin son of Thrain, King under the Mountain, and what do you", "\u201cWho are you,\u201d he called in a very loud voice, \u201cthat come as if in war to the\ngates of Thorin son of Thrain, King under the Mountain, and what do you\ndesire?\u201d\nBut they answered nothing. Some turned swiftly back, and the others\nafter gazing for a while at the Gate and its defences soon followed them.\nThat day the camp was moved to the east of the river, right between the\narms of the Mountain. The rocks echoed then with voices and with song, as\nthey had not done for many a day. There was the sound, too, of elven-harps\nand of sweet music; and as it echoed up towards them it seemed that the\nchill of the air was warmed, and they caught faintly the fragrance of\nwoodland flowers blossoming in spring.\nThen Bilbo longed to escape from the dark fortress and to go down and\njoin in the mirth and feasting by the fires. Some of the younger dwarves", "were moved in their hearts, too, and they muttered that they wished things\nhad fallen out otherwise and that they might welcome such folk as friends;\nbut Thorin scowled.\nThen the dwarves themselves brought forth harps and instruments\nregained from the hoard, and made music to soften his mood; but their song\nwas not as elvish song, and was much like the song they had sung long\nbefore in Bilbo\u2019s little hobbit-hole.\nUnder the Mountain dark and tall\nThe King has come unto his hall!\nHis foe is dead, the Worm of Dread,\nAnd ever so his foes shall fall.\nThe sword is sharp, the spear is long,\nThe arrow swift, the Gate is strong;\nThe heart is bold that looks on gold;\nThe dwarves no more shall suffer wrong.\nThe dwarves of yore made mighty spells,\nWhile hammers fell like ringing bells\nIn places deep, where dark things sleep,\nIn hollow halls beneath the fells.\nOn silver necklaces they strung\nThe light of stars, on crowns they hung\nThe dragon-fire, from twisted wire", "In places deep, where dark things sleep,\nIn hollow halls beneath the fells.\nOn silver necklaces they strung\nThe light of stars, on crowns they hung\nThe dragon-fire, from twisted wire\nThe melody of harps they wrung.\nThe mountain throne once more is freed!\nO! wandering folk, the summons heed!

But Bilbo\u2019s heart fell, both at the song\nand the talk: they sounded much too warlike.\nThe next morning early a company of spearmen was seen crossing the\nriver, and marching up the valley. They bore with them the green banner of\nthe Elvenking and the blue banner of the Lake, and they advanced until they\nstood right before the wall at the Gate.\nAgain Thorin hailed them in a loud voice: \u201cWho are you that come", "the Elvenking and the blue banner of the Lake, and they advanced until they\nstood right before the wall at the Gate.\nAgain Thorin hailed them in a loud voice: \u201cWho are you that come\narmed for war to the gates of Thorin son of Thrain, King under the\nMountain?\u201d This time he was answered.\nA tall man stood forward, dark of hair and grim of face, and he cried:\n\u201cHail Thorin! Why do you fence yourself like a robber in his hold? We are\nnot yet foes, and we rejoice that you are alive beyond our hope. We came\nexpecting to find none living here; yet now that we are met there is matter\nfor a parley and a council.\u201d\n\u201cWho are you, and of what would you parley?\u201d\n\u201cI am Bard, and by my hand was the dragon slain and your treasure\ndelivered. Is that not a matter that concerns you? Moreover I am by right\ndescent the heir of Girion of Dale, and in your hoard is mingled much of the\nwealth of his halls and towns, which of old Smaug stole. Is not that a matter", "descent the heir of Girion of Dale, and in your hoard is mingled much of the\nwealth of his halls and towns, which of old Smaug stole. Is not that a matter\nof which we may speak? Further in his last battle Smaug destroyed the\ndwellings of the men of Esgaroth, and I am yet the servant of their Master. I", "would speak for him and ask whether you have no thought for the sorrow\nand misery of his people. They aided you in your distress, and in\nrecompense you have thus far brought ruin only, though doubtless\nundesigned.\u201d\nNow these were fair words and true, if proudly and grimly spoken; and\nBilbo thought that Thorin would at once admit what justice was in them. He\ndid not, of course, expect that any one would remember that it was he who\ndiscovered all by himself the dragon\u2019s weak spot; and that was just as well,\nfor no one ever did. But also he did not reckon with the power that gold has\nupon which a dragon has long brooded, nor with dwarvish hearts. Long\nhours in the past days Thorin had spent in the treasury, and the lust of it was\nheavy on him. Though he had hunted chiefly for the Arkenstone, yet he had\nan eye for many another wonderful thing that was lying there, about which\nwere wound old memories of the labours and the sorrows of his race.", "an eye for many another wonderful thing that was lying there, about which\nwere wound old memories of the labours and the sorrows of his race.\n\u201cYou put your worst cause last and in the chief place,\u201d Thorin answered.\n\u201cTo the treasure of my people no man has a claim, because Smaug who\nstole it from us also robbed him of life or home. The treasure was not his\nthat his evil deeds should be amended with a share of it. The price of the\ngoods and the assistance that we received of the Lake-men we will fairly\npay\u2014in due time. But nothing will we give, not even a loaf\u2019s worth, under\nthreat of force. While an armed host lies before our doors, we look on you\nas foes and thieves.\n\u201cIt is in my mind to ask what share of their inheritance you would have\npaid to our kindred, had you found the hoard unguarded and us slain.\u201d\n\u201cA just question,\u201d replied Bard. \u201cBut you are not dead, and we are not\nrobbers. Moreover the wealthy may have pity beyond right on the needy", "\u201cA just question,\u201d replied Bard. \u201cBut you are not dead, and we are not\nrobbers. Moreover the wealthy may have pity beyond right on the needy\nthat befriended them when they were in want. And still my other claims\nremain unanswered.\u201d\n\u201cI will not parley, as I have said, with armed men at my gate. Nor at all\nwith the people of the Elvenking, whom I remember with small kindness. In\nthis debate they have no place. Begone now ere our arrows fly! And if you\nwould speak with me again, first dismiss the elvish host to the woods where\nit belongs, and then return, laying down your arms before you approach the\nthreshold.\u201d\n\u201cThe Elvenking is my friend, and he has succoured the people of the\nLake in their need, though they had no claim but friendship on him,\u201d", "answered Bard. \u201cWe will give you time to repent your words.

At the least he shall deliver one twelfth portion of the\ntreasure unto Bard, as the dragon-slayer, and as the heir of Girion. From\nthat portion Bard will himself contribute to the aid of Esgaroth; but if\nThorin would have the friendship and honour of the lands about, as his sires\nhad of old, then he will give also somewhat of his own for the comfort of\nthe men of the Lake.\u201d\nThen Thorin seized a bow of horn and shot an arrow at the speaker.

It\nsmote into his shield and stuck there quivering.\n\u201cSince such is your answer,\u201d he called in return, \u201cI declare the Mountain\nbesieged. You shall not depart from it, until you call on your side for a truce\nand a parley. We will bear no weapons against you, but we leave you to\nyour gold. You may eat that, if you will!\u201d\nWith that the messengers departed swiftly, and the dwarves were left to\nconsider their case. So grim had Thorin become, that even if they had\nwished, the others would not have dared to find fault with him; but indeed\nmost of them seemed to share his mind\u2014except perhaps old fat Bombur\nand Fili and Kili. Bilbo, of course, disapproved of the whole turn of affairs.\nHe had by now had more than enough of the Mountain, and being besieged\ninside it was not at all to his taste.\n\u201cThe whole place still stinks of dragon,\u201d he grumbled to himself, \u201cand it", "He had by now had more than enough of the Mountain, and being besieged\ninside it was not at all to his taste.\n\u201cThe whole place still stinks of dragon,\u201d he grumbled to himself, \u201cand it\nmakes me sick. And cram is beginning simply to stick in my throat.\u201d", "Chapter XVI\nA THIEF IN THE NIGHT\nNow the days passed slowly and wearily. Many of the dwarves spent their\ntime piling and ordering the treasure; and now Thorin spoke of the\nArkenstone of Thrain, and bade them eagerly to look for it in every corner.\n\u201cFor the Arkenstone of my father,\u201d he said, \u201cis worth more than a river\nof gold in itself, and to me it is beyond price. That stone of all the treasure I\nname unto myself, and I will be avenged on anyone who finds it and\nwithholds it.\u201d\nBilbo heard these words and he grew afraid, wondering what would\nhappen, if the stone was found\u2014wrapped in an old bundle of tattered\noddments that he used as a pillow. All the same he did not speak of it, for as\nthe weariness of the days grew heavier, the beginnings of a plan had come\ninto his little head.\nThings had gone on like this for some time, when the ravens brought\nnews that Dain and more than five hundred dwarves, hurrying from the Iron", "into his little head.\nThings had gone on like this for some time, when the ravens brought\nnews that Dain and more than five hundred dwarves, hurrying from the Iron\nHills, were now within about two days\u2019 march of Dale, coming from the\nNorth-East.\n\u201cBut they cannot reach the Mountain unmarked,\u201d said Ro\u00e4c, \u201cand I fear\nlest there be battle in the valley. I do not call this counsel good. Though\nthey are a grim folk, they are not likely to overcome the host that besets\nyou; and even if they did so, what will you gain? Winter and snow is\nhastening behind them. How shall you be fed without the friendship and\ngoodwill of the lands about you? The treasure is likely to be your death,\nthough the dragon is no more!\u201d", "But Thorin was not moved. \u201cWinter and snow will bite both men and\nelves,\u201d he said, \u201cand they may find their dwelling in the waste grievous to\nbear. With my friends behind them and winter upon them, they will perhaps\nbe in softer mood to parley with.\u201d\nThat night Bilbo made up his mind. The sky was black and moonless. As\nsoon as it was full dark, he went to a corner of an inner chamber just within\nthe gate and drew from his bundle a rope, and also the Arkenstone wrapped\nin a rag. Then he climbed to the top of the wall. Only Bombur was there, for\nit was his turn to watch, and the dwarves kept only one watchman at a time.\n\u201cIt is mighty cold!\u201d said Bombur. \u201cI wish we could have a fire up here\nas they have in the camp!\u201d\n\u201cIt is warm enough inside,\u201d said Bilbo.\n\u201cI daresay; but I am bound here till midnight,\u201d grumbled the fat dwarf.\n\u201cA sorry business altogether.

He had about five hours before\nhim. Bombur would sleep (he could sleep at any time, and ever since the\nadventure in the forest he was always trying to recapture the beautiful\ndreams he had then); and all the others were busy with Thorin. It was\nunlikely that any, even Fili or Kili, would come out on the wall until it was\ntheir turn.\nIt was very dark, and the road after a while, when he left the newly made\npath and climbed down towards the lower course of the stream, was strange", "to him. At last he came to the bend where he had to cross the water, if he\nwas to make for the camp, as he wished. The bed of the stream was there\nshallow but already broad, and fording it in the dark was not easy for the\nlittle hobbit. He was nearly across when he missed his footing on a round\nstone and fell into the cold water with a splash. He had barely scrambled\nout on the far bank, shivering and spluttering, when up came elves in the\ngloom with bright lanterns and searched for the cause of the noise.\n\u201cThat was no fish!\u201d one said. \u201cThere is a spy about.

They drove many\nof them into the Running River, and such as fled south or west they hunted\ninto the marshes about the Forest River; and there the greater part of the last\nfugitives perished, while those that came hardly to the Wood-elves\u2019 realm\nwere there slain, or drawn in to die deep in the trackless dark of Mirkwood.\nSongs have said that three parts of the goblin warriors of the North perished\non that day, and the mountains had peace for many a year.\nVictory had been assured before the fall of night; but the pursuit was still", "on that day, and the mountains had peace for many a year.\nVictory had been assured before the fall of night; but the pursuit was still\non foot, when Bilbo returned to the camp; and not many were in the valley\nsave the more grievously wounded.\n\u201cWhere are the Eagles?\u201d he asked Gandalf that evening, as he lay\nwrapped in many warm blankets.\n\u201cSome are in the hunt,\u201d said the wizard, \u201cbut most have gone back to\ntheir eyries.

It is said in songs that it gleamed ever\nin the dark if foes approached, and the fortress of the dwarves could not be\ntaken by surprise. There now Dain son of Nain took up his abode, and he\nbecame King under the Mountain, and in time many other dwarves gathered\nto his throne in the ancient halls.

From that treasure Bard sent much gold to the Master\nof Lake-town; and he rewarded his followers and friends freely.

As they rode down the steep\npath, Bilbo heard the elves still singing in the trees, as if they had not\nstopped since he left; and as soon as the riders came down into the lower\nglades of the wood they burst into a song of much the same kind as before.\nThis is something like it:\nThe dragon is withered,\nHis bones are now crumbled;\nHis armour is shivered,\nHis splendour is humbled!\nThough sword shall be rusted,\nAnd throne and crown perish\nWith strength that men trusted\nAnd wealth that they cherish,\nHere grass is still growing,\nAnd leaves are yet swinging,\nThe white water flowing,\nAnd elves are yet singing\nCome!

There a warm welcome was made\nthem, and there were many eager ears that evening to hear the tale of their\nadventures. Gandalf it was who spoke, for Bilbo was fallen quiet and\ndrowsy.

It appeared that Gandalf had\nbeen to a great council of the white wizards, masters of lore and good\nmagic; and that they had at last driven the Necromancer from his dark hold\nin the south of Mirkwood.\n\u201cEre long now,\u201d Gandalf was saying, \u201cthe Forest will grow somewhat\nmore wholesome.
